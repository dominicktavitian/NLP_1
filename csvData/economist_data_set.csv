Philippe Couillard, the province's Liberal premier, defended the measure with a catchy little formula: ""I should see your face and you should see mine. It's as simple as that.""

When hackers published e-mails from executives at Sony Pictures, a film studio, the world learned that some of Hollywood’s most bankable female stars earned less than their male co-stars. The revelation has since helped women in the industry drive harder bargains. Yet outside Nordic countries transparency faces fierce resistance.

Donald Trump recently cancelled a rule set by Barack Obama requiring large firms to provide more pay data to anti-discrimination regulators. Even those less temperamentally averse to sunlight than Mr Trump balk at what can seem an intrusion into a private matter. That is a shame. Despite the discomfort that transparency can cause, it would be better to publish more information. SWEDES discuss their incomes with a frankness that would horrify Britons or Americans. They have little reason to be coy; in Sweden you can learn a stranger’s salary simply by ringing the tax authorities and asking. Pay transparency can be a potent weapon against persistent inequities.

Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management returns to the top spot for the first time since 2004. Kellogg students praise its facilities and collaborative culture. Their career opportunities are among the best, thanks in part to one of the largest alumni networks in the world; 97% of students find a job within three months of graduation, pocketing a 72% pay bump. All of the top ten slots in the ranking are now occupied by large, prestigious American schools, for which students are happy to pay extra. Their average tuition fee is $134,600, and has risen quickly in recent years. Employers, too, are willing to shell out for the best students. Their average basic salary was $127,300, a 70% increase on their pre-MBA pay cheques. But life, like rankings, isn’t just about money. So we weight data according to what students tell us is important. The four categories covered are: opening new career opportunities (35%), personal development and educational experience (35%), better salary (20%) and networking potential (10%).

That is what India’s new regional connectivity scheme, Ude Desh Ka Aam Nagrik (UDAN) or “let the common man fly”, promises to offer. It uses subsidies to improve the commercial viability of seldom-used routes. It also caps half of the fares on such routes at 2,500 rupees ($38) per hour of travel.

In 2008 the Canadian firm began its attempt to break Airbus and Boeing’s duopoly on smaller jets, spooking the pair into upgrading their own models.

economist,Oct 26th 2017,"After years of persecution, whales are getting their own back"," NO GOOD deed, cynics say, goes unpunished. That is certainly the view of longline fishermen in southern Alaska. The good deed in question is the end of commercial whaling, courtesy of a moratorium agreed, in 1982, by the countries once involved in that trade. Most of the species that have benefited from the moratorium are baleen whales. These feed by filtering small organisms such as krill from the water, using hairy plates (made of tissue called baleen) as sieves. Some whales, though, have teeth, and hunt larger prey, such as fish and squid. The largest of these is the sperm whale, once a prize target for whalers because of the oil contained in an organ that it uses for echolocation. NO GOOD deed, cynics say, goes unpunished.

economist,Oct 26th 2017,The oldest mariner’s astrolabe yields to scientific scrutiny," THESE pictures are of the plate of a mariner’s astrolabe, the earliest known, which was raised in 2014 from a wreck off the coast of Oman. The complete instrument would also have had a rotating pointer, called an alidade, mounted on a pin running through the central hole. The plate itself is 17.5cm in diameter, but less than 2mm thick, and has recently been examined by scanning with a laser beam, by Mark Williams of the University of Warwick, in Britain. Dr Williams used the laser to create a high-resolution, three-dimensional “point cloud” of individual spots on the plate’s surface. This reveals detail invisible to conventional photography. The blue picture, showing the reverse side of the plate from the natural-light picture, is a result of such a scan.

One line of these creatures gave rise to birds. But the rest, though they could not fly, nevertheless seem to have had patterns in their plumage, just as birds do. This can be seen from the distribution in their fossils of pigment particles called melanosomes. And a study led by Fiann Smithwick and Jakob Vinther at the University of Bristol, published this week in Current Biology, reports the discovery of remarkable markings on the face of one such theropod. Sinosauropteryx, it seems, wore bandit masks. IN RECENT years it has become clear that many, if not all, dinosaurs belonging to a group called the theropods had feathers.

Instead of relying on citations in other papers, or the frequency of recurring phrases to rank the relevance of papers, as it once did and rivals such as Google Scholar still do, the new version of Semantic Scholar applies AI to try to understand the context of those phrases, and thus achieve better results.",https://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21730489-get-neural-network-do-it-you-better-way-search-through-scientific

Some years ago Ms Li and her husband, a businessman, moved their elder son from a conventional kindergarten to another one that uses less formal and rigid methods of teaching.

The election ended eight years of rule under Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, a political heir of Juan Perón, an irresponsible populist president of the mid-20th century. In other countries, setbacks for the left followed. Venezuela’s opposition won control of the legislature from the ruling socialist party in December 2015. Brazil’s left-wing president, Dilma Rousseff, was impeached last year; her successor, Michel Temer, is a pro-business centrist.

A MOOD of excitement has gripped the oil industry since OPEC, a cartel of producers, resorted last month to its old trick of rigging the market to shore up prices. After two years of crisis, firms at last scent an end to cheap oil.

The story seemed to be clear: high prices bad, low prices good.

economist,Aug 29th 2017,Why Norway may leave $65bn worth of oil in the ground," EARLIER this month the fjords of Norway’s Lofoten Islands rang out with the cries of activists. For an entire week, environmental groups and local fishermen rallied to oppose plans to drill for oil near the pristine archipelago. The demonstrations were timely: Norway is due to hold parliamentary elections in September, and the country’s two main parties—Labour and the Conservatives—are both in favour of lifting a ban on oil excavation around Lofoten. The areas surrounding the archipelago are estimated to hold 1.3bn barrels in resources, equivalent to more than $65bn at today’s prices, if all of that is found to be easily accessible oil. Norway’s oil production has nearly halved over the past 15 years, and is set to fall by another 11% by 2019. The government says Lofoten “must at some point come into play”. Yet many analysts expect the moratorium to remain. Why? EARLIER this month the fjords of Norway’s Lofoten Islands rang out with the cries of activists.

In the past two years they have found reserves of around 2bn barrels. Five more promising prospects will be drilled by 2018, and then perhaps a dozen more.

economist,Apr 6th 2017,Oil struggles to enter the digital age," IT SOUNDS like a spectacular feat of engineering. Employees of Royal Dutch Shell located in Calgary, Canada, recently drilled a well 6,200 miles (10,000km) away in Vaca Muerta, Argentina. In fact, the engineers of the Anglo-Dutch oil major were using computers to perform what they call “virtual drilling”, based on their knowledge of Fox Creek, a shale bed in Alberta, which has similar geological features to Argentina’s biggest shale deposit. They used real-time data sent from a rig in Vaca Muerta to design the well and control the speed and pressure of the drilling. On their second try, they completed the well for $5.4m, down from $15m a few years ago. “It’s the cheapest well we’ve drilled in Argentina,” says Ben van Beurden, Shell’s chief executive.

economist,Mar 27th 2017,Anti-corruption demonstrations sweep across Russia," VLADIMIR PUTIN won his first presidential election on March 26th 2000. Exactly 17 years later, tens of thousands of Russians across the country came out to protest the corruption that has come to define his tenure. The demonstrations, the most significant challenge to Mr Putin’s regime since 2012, began on Russia’s Pacific coast, where hundreds marched through Vladivostok. Throughout the day reports of rallies, most of them unsanctioned, flowed in from dozens of cities, including metropolises like Novosibirsk and Yekaterinburg, industrial centres like Chelyabinsk and Nizhny Tagil, and even Makhachkala, capital of Dagestan, a North Caucasian region where Mr Putin regularly receives more than 90% of the vote. The largest crowds emerged in Moscow and in St Petersburg, where they spilled onto Palace Square—an echo of the 1917 Russian revolution that is unlikely to be lost on the Kremlin.

economist,Oct 25th 2017,South Korea’s soaring minimum wage," SOUTH KOREAN workers don’t often have cause for cheer. They slog for more hours than their counterparts in any other member of the OECD, a club of mostly rich countries, apart from Mexico. Yet the worst-off, at least, will soon be far better rewarded for their toil. Next year the country’s minimum wage will leap by 16.4% to 7,530 won ($6.65) an hour, the most vigorous hike since 2000. The government wants the lowest-paid to earn 10,000 won an hour by 2020—a total increase of 55%. That would mean the country’s minimum wage would be roughly 70% of its median wage, far higher than the level in other major economies.

economist,Nov 4th 2016,Chilling time for cars," AFTER seven years of frustrated effort, climate negotiators from the 197 countries that signed the 1987 Montreal Protocol—an international treaty designed to end the use of chemicals that deplete the ozone layer—have agreed to phase out the global-warming chemicals known as hydrofluorocarbons. HFCs are the fastest-growing sector of greenhouse gases. Their use around the world is increasing by 10%-15% a year, as popular household goods that use them as refrigerants (eg, fridges and  air-conditioning equipment) or propellants  (eg, aerosol sprays) spread to even the remotest parts of the planet.Though HFCs do not deplete Earth’s ozone layer in the way the chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) they replaced back in the mid-1990s did, they contribute disproportionately to global warming, being far more potent at trapping heat than carbon dioxide is. One of the most widely used HFCs, R-134a, a refrigerant used in the air-conditioning equipment of cars, has a global warming potential (GWP) of 1,430—ie, weight for weight, it is 1,430 worse than carbon dioxide. All told, R-134a is the most abundant HFC in the atmosphere, accounting for a quarter of the total the annual output.That has made HFCs in general, and R-134a in particular, public enemy number one for the global-warming police. If fully implemented, the new agreement, reached at a meeting in Kigali, Rwanda, on October 15th, would go a long way towards achieving the UN’s target of limiting the rise in global temperature to no more than 2°C by 2050. John Kerry, the American secretary of state who participated in the Kigali talks, claimed triumphantly that replacing today’s HFCs with less harmful chemicals could reduce that increase by as much as 0.5°C. If so, that would be a big deal.

economist,Jan 17th 2017,Toxic emissions from cars may be several times higher than the legal limit," CARMAKERS are again in regulators’ headlights over emissions, on both sides of the Atlantic. On January 13th French prosecutors announced they were investigating Renault for “suspected cheating” on diesel emissions. A day earlier, America’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) accused Fiat Chrysler (whose chairman, John Elkann, sits on the board of The Economist’s parent company) of using undeclared software in 104,000 diesel-engined Jeeps and Dodge Ram pick-ups. The EPA says that the software increases emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) from the vehicles in normal use, and was not declared or justified by the carmaker. It is illegal to fail to inform the EPA of software that might affect emissions, although the agency stopped short of saying it was a ""defeat device"". In 2015 Volkswagen (VW) admitted installing “defeat devices” in several models that were designed to hide the true level of emissions from vehicles during the testing process. VW has coughed up more than $20bn so far in fines and compensation for the 600,000 American vehicles in question.

economist,Jan 13th 2016,Why diesel cars are under threat," GLOBAL efforts to combat climate change have focused on reducing emissions of carbon dioxide. After a global agreement was signed in Kyoto in 1997, carmakers—especially in Europe—began producing small efficient diesel engines which emitted less CO2 than petrol engines. The European Union, which had pledged to make huge cuts in carbon emissions at Kyoto, enthusiastically embraced diesel as a means to reduce CO2. Governments taxed diesel less than petrol and taxed vehicles according to CO2 emissions, making diesel vehicles a cheaper running prospect for motorists. Now half of all cars sold in Europe are diesels. But diesel engines have a dirty secret that Europe has been slow to recognise and control. Namely, they emit far higher levels of other polluting gases such as non-methane organic gases (NMOG) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) than petrol engines. Both of these are more harmful to respiratory health than CO2 and are the cause of a large number of premature deaths—perhaps 58,000 a year in America alone—one study suggests.

economist,Dec 8th 2015,Why it is nearly impossible for America to pass gun-control laws," ONE day after 14 people died and 21 were injured in a mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, America's Senate defeated a bill that would have prevented people on the terror watch list from buying guns. Making things a bit more difficult for people bent on killing Americans might sound like a rather moderate reform. But 54 conservative senators determined that such a rule might impinge on the gun rights of innocent Americans who were mistakenly placed on the watch-list—a risk assessment that is hard to square with the calculus used by many of the same lawmakers who oppose resettling Syrian refugees lest one of them turn into a terrorist. In the wake of the school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut that killed 20 children and 6 staff members in 2012, a bipartisan bill to enhance background checks for gun purchasers came up a few votes short. It was voted down last week as well. It seems even the mildest measure to curb guns in America is doomed to fail.

economist,May 12th 2016,Restrictive laws do not necessarily lower abortion rates," TRACKING abortion rates is a hard task. Some countries under-report them, and many do not report them at all. A new paper published in the Lancet, led by Gilda Sedgh of the Guttmacher Institute, and the World Health Organisation, is only the fourth such study, and supersedes previous estimates that are considered too conservative. The authors (who also produced the last study four years ago) estimate that the global rate fell slightly from 40 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15-44 in 1990, to 35 in 2014. But this masks a wide variation by income and by region. In the developed world, rates declined dramatically from 46 to 27 as better family planning and education became available to women to prevent unintended pregnancies. The steepest drop was seen in eastern Europe following the break-up of the Soviet Union, as women gained access to family planning and modern contraception. By contrast, the abortion rate has stayed relatively unchanged in developing regions and the share of pregnancies ending in abortion has nudged up from 21% to 24%. This matters: 50m of the 56m abortions every year are in developing countries. In Latin America, which has restrictive abortion laws and the highest abortion rates, one in three pregnancies ended in abortion in 2014, higher than any other region. Restrictive laws do not appear to lower the number of procedures, but do increase the likelihood of health risks to women who must seek unsafe procedures. Around $300m a year is spent treating an estimated 7m women who suffer complications after unsafe abortions.",https://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2016/05/new-global-abortion-study

economist,Oct 22nd 2016,Let the haggling begin," “THIS is betrayal,” thundered Saskatchewan’s long-serving premier, Brad Wall. His grievance: the decision this month by Canada’s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, to set a minimum price for carbon emissions that all provinces would have to adhere to. Since taking office nearly a year ago, Mr Trudeau and his ministers have spent much of their time consulting the provinces (and ordinary Canadians) on such issues as judicial reform and defence. His carbon-price announcement marks a transition from talking to acting, and a new contentious phase in relations between the federal government and the ten provinces. Canada’s grand political bazaar, in which the prime minister and the premiers strike the bargains that determine how the country will be governed, is again open for business. “THIS is betrayal,” thundered Saskatchewan’s long-serving premier, Brad Wall.

The singer, looking remarkably similar to his late-’80s self, covered his own hit song, but sang the whole thing in order of pitch.

Mr Astley stammers out different lines in a jumble, going from dulcet bass tones to shrill trebles over a tortuous three-and-a-half minutes.

In fact, for now, China can probably avoid a disastrous crash (see article).

economist,May 18th 2017,Why Harvard Business School is under fire," HARVARD BUSINESS SCHOOL (HBS) has come under the cosh this month.

economist,Nov 18th 2016,Donald Trump chooses Jeff Sessions for attorney-general," DONALD TRUMP's nomination of Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama (pictured) as attorney-general—making the hardest of nativist hardliners the country’s top law officer and head of the Department of Justice—is a timely reminder that words spoken on the campaign trail have meaning, that politics is not showbusiness, and that America’s government takes decisions that make or break lives, shape economies and set norms across the globe. In the immediate aftermath of Mr Trump’s election, some boosters suggested that the president-elect is not really an ideologue, might bring moderates into his administration and is perhaps barely interested in the business of governing at all—for all the world as if P.T. Barnum were headed for the White House. The nomination of Mr Sessions suggests that is wishful thinking.

economist,Jan 20th 2016,Obama’s immigration orders to be scrutinised by the Supreme Court," FOR THE third straight year, the Supreme Court will ask whether Barack Obama overstepped his executive authority under the constitution. In 2014, the justices slapped Mr Obama on the wrist for taking liberties in making unilateral appointments to federal agencies while the Senate (which is supposed to give its “advice and consent”) was in session. Last year, they evened the score, siding with the White House in a tussle with Congress over who gets to recognise foreign governments. This spring, Mr Obama’s controversial moves with regard to immigration face a major challenge at the nation’s highest court. The Supreme Court agreed on January 19th to review lower-court decisions blocking the president’s actions to make life easier for nearly 5m illegal immigrants. A year away from his departure from the Oval Office, Mr Obama now has one more chance to persuade a court to give his immigration policy the green light.
