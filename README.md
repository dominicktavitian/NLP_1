# Fake news w/ NLP 

This repo tries to predict fake news using NLP. 

In result, The data used to find out if fake news could be predicted wasn't comprehensive enough, but with the correct set of actual contriversal news articles, I believe this model and steps to a result to be a good path of determining if news is fake are not. 

There are some things that are missing because I accidently moved the other files to another location and until I find push them onto here, this is what I believe to be missing: 

    * Kaggle fakenews set that was used to compare the scraped articles against. 

    * NPR and PBS scrapers

    * NPR Data 

    * outputted data to run the read and write functions in scripts of Data_Cleaning, modeling, & EDA. 
    
    * By gathering your own data, you just need to change the read and write functions to your own paths of wherevery your data is. 

I also converted some of the python scripts from jupyter notebooks - it could be a bit sloppy. 

Feel free to message me any other feedback you may have!
