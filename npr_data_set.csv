""Where he does things with camera, with lighting, with editing that communicates meaning. These six made the grade."" This is the third such film fest organized by McBride, but the first with a film director to attend film school and the only living film director. The first Six Week Film Festival a year ago focused on film noir and femme fatales. Earlier this year, McBride led a fest focused on Hitchcock. There's a vast Scorsese film library from which to choose. McBride said filmgoers may notice there are no mafia-related films, although the director is known for these films. ""Goodfellas"" is a fan favorite. ""The Departed"" won the Oscar for Best Picture.  ""It might be me going against the grain,"" said McBride, who also pointed out that the films that are included meet the style threshold.  There is a gangster film, however, ""Gangs of New York,"" but it's set in 1863. McBride says while the film festival is focused on style, he says it made the cut because of an actor performance.           The movie poster for the 1976 film Taxi Driver, showing at the Normal Theater on Oct. 4.       ""That performance of Butcher Bill is just brilliant, Daniel Day-Lewis, the great Irish actor,"" said McBride. As for the first film in the series, ""Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore,"" McBride said Scorsese was able to get excellent performances from Ellen Burstyn and Kris Kristofferson, who at the time was known more as a singer-songwriter than an actor.  ""This is the beginning of his acting career and Scorsese to have cast him first off is a brilliant gesture and what he gets from him is equally great,"" said McBride. Six Week Film School runs through Nov. 8. All shows are Wednesdays at 7 p.m. at the Normal Theater.  Six Week Film School ""Alice to Silence: The Scorsese Style"" schedule:           Listen  Listening...              / 3:44   An excerpt from GLT's story about The Six Week Film Festival            Listen  Listening...              / 19:26   GLT's full story about The Six Week Film Festival    WGLT depends on financial support from users to bring you stories and interviews like this one.

npr,"Oct 23,  2017",Officials In Douglas County Seek Changes In Kansas’ Review Of Saltwater Injection Wells," In its current format, she said, “the process itself is really weighted against the ability of the citizens to be heard.” The county and city say a longer public comment period would better suit the schedules of city and county commissioners, so that they can study any potential effects and discuss them during their public meetings. Local governments don’t have authority to block applications by oil and gas companies to build and operate fluid injection wells within their boundaries — that power rests with the Kansas Corporation Commission. But, like members of the public, they can view application materials and file letters of protest. Douglas County Administrator Craig Weinaug said the county wants more time and information to determine whether a proposal by Florida-based Midstates Energy Operating LLC to operate two wells poses any risks for water contamination or earthquakes. “We think that as government officials we have an obligation to make sure when something like this is done, it’s done in a way that it protects the public,” Weinaug said. “So we are asking, ‘What has the Corporation Commission done to make those determinations?’ And once we get an answer on what they have done, we’d like a chance to question it, add additional information, so we can decide whether they’ve done a good job in protecting our interests.” Public concern In the latest example of growing public interest in saltwater injection, Lawrence and Douglas County officials sent a joint letter last week to the KCC. Read the letter to the Kansas Corporation Commission from Lawrence and Douglas County officials. Saltwater injection consists of pouring — with or without pressurization — brine down a well either to dispose of it or to assist in extracting oil and gas. The saltwater is wastewater that is itself churned up in the course of oil or gas production and can contain chemicals. A spike in earthquakes in Oklahoma and south-central Kansas in recent years has fueled public concerns about saltwater injection because geophysicists have pinned a rise in seismic activity on saltwater disposal wells. In some parts of that region, operators can inject upwards of 15,000 barrels of brine into each well per day. Since 2009, thousands of temblors with a magnitude of 2.7 or higher — meaning quakes strong enough to be felt by people — have struck the region.  Wells are marked active or inactive based on whether they reported saltwater injection in 2016, the most current data available. EOR (enhanced oil recovery) wells inject saltwater to help extract oil. SWD (saltwater disposal) wells inject saltwater to get rid of it. Data source: Kansas Corporation Commission. Map: Celia Llopis-Jepsen/Kansas News Service. The permits sought by Midstates Energy in Douglas County are for extraction rather than disposal wells, according to documents filed with the KCC. The company is seeking to inject 100 barrels of brine per day into the two wells to assist in oil or gas production. Bruce Presgrave, a USGS supervisory geophysicist at the National Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colorado, said it’s impossible to know whether a proposed saltwater injection site will cause earthquakes. In some places, higher-volume wells don’t cause quakes, while lower-volume wells in other locations do. “There’s no magic formula that works everywhere,” Presgrave said. “That’s part of the problem.” However, higher volumes correlate with higher risk of seismicity. The USGS also says saltwater wells used for disposal purposes are more likely to cause earthquakes than their extraction-related counterparts. Local geological characteristics, such as proximity to fault lines, also play a role. Overall, most saltwater injection wells are not linked to earthquakes. Presgrave said there is “a growing body of evidence” that state regulators and oil companies can reduce impact by monitoring wells and adjusting or cutting off injection as needed — though the extent to which states and companies do this can vary. “With some care, this can be worked with, and the hazard can be mitigated,” he said, “and still achieve the economic issue of being able to get the oil out and do something with the fluid.” Flint Hills well approved In recent months, residents of the Flint Hills fought plans for a saltwater disposal well near the Tallgrass Prairie National Preserve. They failed to block a bid from Quail Oil &amp; Gas for a permit, but their effort grew into a broader campaign to engage the public in monitoring and protesting any new applications that companies file for saltwater injection in their region.        “We think that as government officials we have an obligation to make sure when something like this is done, it’s done in a way that it protects the public.” — Douglas County Administrator Craig Weinaug     The protestors also are lobbying legislators for changes to state law, arguing that the state’s current regulatory framework doesn’t require the KCC to factor in seismicity risks when reviewing well applications. In its September decision allowing the Flint Hills well to proceed, the KCC concluded protestors hadn’t proven any “immediate danger” to public health, safety or welfare. But the protestors argue Kansas should take a more proactive stance. They fear faulty wells or unscrupulous dumping could contaminate local freshwater and argue that Kansas failed to rein in saltwater disposal in south-central parts of the state until earthquakes had become a frequent occurrence. In recent years, the KCC has capped daily injection volumes in parts of that region. Midstates Energy notice On Oct. 9, Midstates Energy published notices in the Lawrence Journal-World to meet legal requirements for informing the public of its plans. Its applications are still pending with the KCC. The notices said residents had 15 days to file any protests against the company’s two wells, setting an Oct. 24 deadline. On Friday a KCC spokeswoman said the company’s notice was incorrect, because the legal public comment period should be 30 days. The agency is contacting Midstates to let the company know it will need to redo the public notification process. State regulations require companies planning injection activities to publish a notice in the county’s designated newspaper, in addition to notifying the local landowner and any well operators or owners of mineral rights within half a mile. Midstates didn’t return a call seeking comment. The Florida company registered in Kansas in September, according to filings with the Kansas Secretary of State’s Office. In addition to Midstates’ pending applications for Douglas County wells, records on the Kansas Geological Survey website indicate the company received permits this month to drill three injection wells in Franklin County, south of Douglas County. Thellman said Douglas County’s decision to contact the KCC about the two wells there came amid calls and emails from constituents worried about the environmental risks. “Certainly the word has spread — word of mouth, social media, environmental organizations,” she said. “I continue to get lots of emails and phone calls. It’s gotten quite a bit of attention.” Celia Llopis-Jepsen is a reporter for the Kansas News Service, a collaboration of KCUR, Kansas Public Radio, KMUW and High Plains Public Radio covering health, education and politics.

npr,N/A,Harris County Judge Ed Emmett: Hurricane Harvey ‘By Far The Worst’," But “improvements do work,” Emmett said, citing the example of the Texas Medical Center, which he said hasn’t flooded since Hurricane Allison in 2001. “We’ve just got to have the political will and financial resources to do it.”  Timely relief will be key to Hurricane Harvey recovery, Harris County Judge Ed Emmett told Maggie Martin of Houston Matters during a Houston Public Media Facebook Live conversation on Tuesday. The storm, he said, was “by far the worst, no question,” that he’s experienced in 10 years as Harris County judge, and preparing for it presented complex challenges. “I like to say lightheartedly there’s a lot of warm, fuzzy feelings because we got through the storm,” he said. “Those warm, fuzzy feelings will go away very quickly if people still have debris in their front yard and if they haven’t gotten relief from FEMA in terms of individual assistance or housing assistance. Those two have to be job one.” Improvements to mitigate future flood risk are also important, he said. Because of changes such as installation of flood doors at the Texas Medical Center, which suffered an estimated $2 billion in damage after Hurricane Allison in 2001, “The medical center hasn’t flooded again,” he noted. “So improvements do work. We’ve just got to have the political will and financial resources to do it.” Is a third reservoir a possibility for the area? For years, Emmett said, the idea for a reservoir “has been on the plans” for Cypress Creek, which experienced severe flooding due to Harvey. “But years ago, it was decided not to build it, because nobody was ever going to live that far out. Well, obviously we’ve grown. And now it makes it more difficult to construct it because the land’s become more valuable.” Meanwhile, Emmett emphasized the need for a comprehensive hydrology study. “We need to think about where are the natural watersheds, where does the water flow naturally in our area,” he said. “And then we need to complete the jobs that are already planned on the various watersheds.

npr,"October 25, 2017",All-Time High: Majority Of Republicans Support Pot Legalization For First Time," For the first time, a majority of Republicans are in favor of legalizing marijuana, according to a Gallup poll out Wednesday. Fifty-one percent of Republicans tell Gallup that, yes, marijuana should be legal, up from 42 percent last year. That support has led to a whopping two-thirds of Americans (64 percent) supporting pot legalization, the highest ever recorded by Gallup. Gallup has data on the question since 1969. How quickly has support for marijuana changed among Americans? In 2004, just over a third supported it. Roughly that many Democrats were in favor, and only 20 percent of Republicans were. Majority of REPUBLICANS for first time in favor of legalization pic.twitter.com/ajqyM6E3Ni What has changed? Half the country has moved toward marijuana legalization in some form — with more than a half-dozen states having legalized pot for recreational use and more than dozen others having legalized medical marijuana. (Governing has a good map of that.) As Gallup's Justin McCarthy notes, ""As efforts to legalize marijuana at the state level continue to yield successes, public opinion, too, has shifted toward greater support."" Yet, the Trump administration has taken a tack in the opposite direction. ""When you see something like the opioid addiction crisis blossoming in so many states around this country, the last thing we need to be doing is encouraging people,"" said then-White House press secretary Sean Spicer several months ago. ""There is still a federal law we need to abide by."" President Trump's attorney general, Jeff Sessions, has a long record of being no fan of marijuana. In the 1980s, his nomination for a federal judgeship was derailed, in part, because of the revelation that he had joked that he thought the KKK was ""OK until I found out they smoked pot."" As a senator, Sessions was very much set against marijuana, remarking during a hearing just last year: ""Good people don't smoke marijuana."" Of course, there is no guarantee that support stays at these levels, as NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben noted last year, especially if there are unintended consequences in the states where it's legal — and if as millennials get older and have children, they change their minds. But the trend in public opinion at this point is undeniable. NPR thanks our sponsors Become an NPR sponsor ",http://www.npr.org/559989879

npr,"Sep 11,  2017",Diabetics Protest Rising Insulin Prices At Drug Company Headquarters," The frustration bubbled over at a rally in front of Eli Lilly headquarters in downtown Indianapolis Saturday. Protestors held signs reading “Insulin for All” and “Insulin = Life.” The protest of a few dozen people comprised what organizers believe is the first demonstration of its kind. Insulin’s rapidly-rising cost — and lack of an affordable, generic option — is putting people’s health at risk, protestors say, and making them a slave to the price of the vital hormone. Mike Hoskins, a Type 1 diabetic, said he has good health insurance, but still goes without insulin sometimes to save money. “I don’t use it as much,” he said, “Sometimes, I adjust what I’m eating or my routine so I don’t have to spend as much on insulin.” Horror stories abound of diabetics skimping on injections — or even intentionally slipping into a coma to receive doses of insulin inside the ER. Some diabetics can’t function without insulin, and in some cases, not taking enough can be life-threateningly dangerous. The Indianapolis-based Lilly was the first company to mass-produce insulin in the 1980s. The company is now one of three manufacturers, along with the European companies Sanofi and Novo Nordisk, that dominate the market for the hormone. The trio is now facing a class-action lawsuit accusing them of price-fixing. According to the lawsuit, the list price of Lilly’s drug, called Humalog, has doubled in the past five years. In the mid-‘90s, when the drug was first launched, it cost $21 a vial. Now, list price for that same amount is $274. The other two companies have similarly raised their prices (and in such lockstep that critics say it is more than coincidence). Usually, when a drug has been on the market for decades, a cheap generic will become available, making it more accessible. No such generic exists for diabetics, thanks to insulin’s complicated biology. It’s not technically a drug, it’s a substance called a biologic, made from living cells, and re-creating it is more difficult. Insulin isn’t a static medicine, either. Companies continue to tweak their formulas, extending their patents’ lifespans.          An inscription outside Eli Lilly headquarters near downtown Indianapolis.  Credit Jill Sheridan / Indiana Public Broadcasting     In response to the increasing outrage over insulin pricing, Lilly, along with pharmacy middleman Express Scripts, has introduced a program to make the hormone more accessible, offering discounts to patients who buy the drug through a third party website called Blink Health. But the 40 percent discount only applies to people paying full price for three of Lilly’s insulin products, including Humalog. That’s people without insurance or in high-deductible health plans. Protestor Angela Lautner found out she wasn’t eligible for several patient-assistance plans when she lost her job. “I was denied every single one of them, including Eli Lilly’s patient-assistance program,” said Lautner. Last year, Lilly defended its prices, saying that thanks to rebate systems, the “real” price patients pay hasn’t gone up since 2009 — middlemen called pharmacy benefit managers absorb the “list” price increases. Hoskins said he thinks there are problems at every level, from the pharmacy benefit managers, to the wholesalers, to government policies. “At the end of the day it’s too complicated for people to understand, and it really doesn’t go anywhere, and it’s a huge problem,” he said. Lautner understands the health care system is complicated but thinks ultimately the price tag is just too much. “I honestly don’t think my insurance company should have to pay the $1,400 that Walgreens put on my receipt last week for a month of insulin,” said Lautner. In an email, a Lilly spokesman said the company has been an active participant in the insulin access dialogue for a long time, and we will continue to listen to patients.

And he asked that the two governments meet as soon as possible to open up a dialogue over the next two months. And this is also important that he didn't say yes or no explicitly because on Saturday, Spain's interior minister had said that the central government would suspend Catalonia's autonomy if it didn't get a clear response from the regional leader. So now, like you said, they've given a new deadline of Thursday for the Catalan government to back away from independence before they invoke this Article 155 of the Spanish Constitution, which would temporarily suspend the autonomy of the region.

Why is he keeping this ambiguity going? BENAVIDES: Right. And I think he he wants to open up the dialogue and not have a very hardline yes independence or no to independence. The last thing people want here is for the Spanish government to take over more control because they're asking for more autonomy, not less. And, you know, the Spanish government has a bit of a history of not negotiating with Catalonia when they ask for more autonomy. That's actually how we got to this point. Back in 2010, the Catalan government had passed a statute of autonomy to have more control over their collection of taxes. And the Spanish court struck that down. So since then, in the last seven years or so, we've seen an increase of separatist sentiment in the Catalan region because of this, you know, lack of the Spanish government willing to negotiate. And so it's built up a little bit more than they were originally kind of looking for. MARTIN: You've been talking with folks. How are residents in Catalonia? How's all this settling with them? BENAVIDES: Yeah. So, you know, this has been going on for a couple of weeks now. So at first, it was very energetic. A lot of people were very excited that they were finally voting on whether or not they wanted independence from Spain. A lot of people thought this is finally the moment where Catalonia gets its own country, its own nation. But it's kind of simmered down in the last two weeks because last Tuesday, the Catalan president declared independence. And then eight seconds later, he said well we're suspending independence for now in order to open up dialogue. People are joking around that it's the shortest-lived declaration of independence in the history of the world. But, you know, there's - people are trying to figure out what's going to happen because this is unprecedented. This Article 155 has never been used before. So it's kind of unclear what exactly is going to happen. And it keeps kind of dragging on. MARTIN: Lucia Benavides is a freelance journalist in Barcelona - she spoke to us on FaceTime this morning - where the government of Spain has now imposed a new deadline for the leader of Catalonia to clear up his independence push.

npr,"October 9, 2017","As Lawmakers Re-Write Policy, Dairy Farmers Push For Change"," “Our inputs have gone up so much, not the feed part of it but everything else,” he says, pointing to veterinary care and, especially, labor. “For us to make that profit, [it] makes it very tough.” Dairy farmers like Fick want some reassurance that the market for milk will pay them enough to stay in business. Meanwhile, when you head to the supermarket, you want the milk on the shelves to be abundant and affordable. The federal government for decades has stepped into that equation to keep things stable in the dairy industry. But Fick and other dairy farmers say the government&amp;apos;s current safety net program does not work. Fick is enrolled in the Margin Protection Program, a form of government-subsidized insurance that came online with the 2014 Farm Bill, the massive law that governs everything from food stamp benefits to farm supports, including the dairy program. Farmers pay a flat fee to join the Margin Protection Program and they get a payout if their margin gets too tight— that&amp;apos;s the difference between the cost of feeding cows and the price farmers get for milk. They can pay extra for more coverage. “The first time I went a little bit higher level and now I&amp;apos;m at the lower level,” Fick says, “and it doesn&amp;apos;t work. It&amp;apos;s just been a failure all the way through.” Even the Department of Agriculture, which administers the program, says it is not working as intended. It is letting producers opt out early if they want. But Fick does believe some kind federal help is necessary. Twenty years ago, the U.S. had almost three times as many dairy farms as the 41,000 it has today. “Unfortunately, there&amp;apos;s not that many people left to quit, so it&amp;apos;s really a serious issue nowadays,” he says. “There&amp;apos;s so much milk surplus in the United States that we don&amp;apos;t know where to go with this milk anymore.” Why do we have too much milk with fewer dairies? Modern technology makes farms more efficient, but to make money, they must achieve economies of scale. And that often means growing much bigger. Some have thousands of cows. In March, the country had 9.4 million dairy cows, the highest number in 20 years. More cows mean more milk. Global markets buy up some of our dairy products, but then farmers anticipate a strong export opportunity, gear up to sell internationally, and watch as trade winds blow a different direction. China and Russia had been big milk importers, but their demand has slowed. U.S. farmers are left producing excess milk, and while much of it is processed into cheese, yogurt, ice cream, and milk powders, which have a longer shelf-life than fresh milk, the oversupply drags the price farmers get down even more. “You can't have a program that's too generous because it will generate too much milk production and ultimately be self-defeating,” says National Milk Producers Federation vice president Chris Galen. But he says farmers do need to see tangible benefits. Now is the time for change, Galen adds, as Congress tackles the next farm bill. Some senators have suggested the traditionally bipartisan bill could get through Congress yet this year, well ahead of the fall 2018 expiration date on the current one. Galen&amp;apos;s group, other dairy industry advocates and some farm-sector powerhouses such as the American Farm Bureau Federation will be pushing for reforming rather than replacing the program. For example, Galen says the formula the government uses to calculate margin is flawed. “The overall margin that's being measured every month at the national level doesn't really reflect what the true economics are on dairy farms,” he says. Galen says better math would calculate prices and costs more accurately. He says the government uses average prices for corn, soybean meal and alfalfa, which are the primary feed ingredients, that underestimate what farmers are actually paying. In addition, he says premiums farmers pay for coverage above the baseline need to be calculated every month rather than every two months to be more useful to farmers. In the past, the Department of Agriculture attempted to shore up falling prices by purchasing dairy products in times of surplus. But Galen says that program became very expensive for the government and did not provide an adequate safety net to dairy farmers. Still, even an improved program likely won&amp;apos;t please everyone. Matt Schelling, another northwest Iowa dairy farmer, with 150 cows near Orange City, says generally dairy programs have helped small farmers like him. “On the one hand, that&amp;apos;s nice for us,” he says. “On the other hand, is that really fair to the industry and to the taxpayer that&amp;apos;s subsidizing that?” Maybe it is time to see whether the industry can stand on its own, he says. Dairies might be okay without subsidies, though that&amp;apos;s very much an open question, but there is no doubt about something else: they need workers. Many dairies depend on immigrant labor to do the daily, year-round, physical, smelly work. “It&amp;apos;s been at a crisis level for the last couple of years and it&amp;apos;s getting quickly more critical as workers leave the country and whatnot,” Schelling says. As Congress drafts the next farm bill, farmers will be watching to see whether anything from Washington, D.C. makes a difference in the dairy barn.  [[{""type"":""media"",""view_mode"":""media_small"",""fid"":""168818"",""attributes"":{""alt"":"""",""class"":""media-image"",""height"":""66"",""style"":""width: 224px; height: 66px; float: left;"",""typeof"":""foaf:Image"",""width"":""224""}}]]Harvest Public Media is a reporting collaboration focused on issues of food, fuel and field.

 Coal stockpiled at a power plant. On Capitol Hill Thursday, Energy Secretary Rick Perry defended a controversial proposal to subsidize coal and nuclear power plants. ""There's no such thing as a free market in energy,"" he said in testimony before the House Energy and Commerce Committee. ""Governments are picking winners and losers every day."" It was a remarkable statement, coming days after EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt derided such tipping of the scales as he moved to repeal the Obama-era Clean Power Plan. Perry announced his Grid Resiliency Pricing Rule proposal in a notice sent at the end of September to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. It suggests that to ensure grid reliability, coal and nuclear — so-called base load generators — should be paid to maintain a 90-day stockpile of fuel. Perry contends this would help prevent widespread power outages like those caused by the recent powerful hurricanes. The proposal has been met with delight by the coal and nuclear industries, both of which are struggling to compete with cheaper natural gas, wind and solar. But other parts of the energy world have cried foul, predicting that such a move would ""blow up energy markets"" and radically reshape the U.S. electricity industry. What's it all mean, and why should I care? The power grid is like an auction. When a regional grid operator is looking for power, each generator, be it a coal plant on the edge of town or a wind farm in a different state, offers its electricity for whatever price it can make at a given time. The grid operator lines up all the bids, from the cheapest (usually wind or solar) to most expensive (often coal, gas or oil) and comes up with a cutoff price, depending on electricity demand. The grid operator dispatches electricity from all the generators with bids below that cutoff price. In recent years, cheap natural gas and renewable energy have caused that cutoff price to drop. As a result, generators that are more expensive to operate, like coal, are not being used, or are turned on and off as needed. That's not an efficient use of a coal plant, and many just cannot afford to compete in this market saturated with cheap natural gas (which can be turned off and on), wind and solar. What would this mean for coal? The coal industry and its supporters, like Perry, argue that coal and nuclear are a base load power that's needed to keep the lights on ""when the wind isn't blowing or the sun isn't shining."" But because coal and nuclear can't compete with cheaper (and cleaner) sources of power, they need to be subsidized. Perry also argues coal and nuclear are critical in extreme weather events, where on-site storage means power is there when it is needed. On Capitol Hill he specifically cited the 2014 ""polar vortex"" cold snap, although environmental groups point out that even coal plants had problems then, including frozen stockpiles of coal. In fact, the Department of Energy's own recent ""grid reliability"" study  found the current grid is highly reliable, despite an ever decreasing amount of coal-fired generation. As the grid is further transformed there will be new challenges that have to be overcome, the report concluded. Still, as one energy commentator put it, Perry's proposal to subsidize coal and nuclear is a ""solution in search of a problem."" If this happens, would my electric bill go up? FERC is an independent body and doesn't have to do the Department of Energy's bidding. But at least one FERC commissioner has indicated that he believes coal should be subsidized. If the plan in some part is accepted, it would only affect electricity markets in about two-thirds of the country, those that have been restructured into regional or independent transmission organizations. And in many places, even those markets wouldn't be affected because they have little or no coal or nuclear generation (California, New York and New England, for instance). Texas won't be affected, because the state runs its own grid and is not under the jurisdiction of FERC. The part of the country that would have to deal with the most subsidies is the Mid-Atlantic region, home to the largest wholesale power market in the world. Some foresee ""hundreds of applications"" from distressed coal and nuclear plants, and that would be expensive. Electricity prices would go up. Some analysts believe this would threaten wholesale markets across the country. Will it actually happen? A broad coalition of strange bedfellows has come out against Perry's proposal,  from renewable energy companies to the American Petroleum Institute, which lobbies on behalf of natural gas. Even some conservative groups with ties to the Trump administration describe Perry's proposal as ""using a sledgehammer to swat a fly."" Others note that by choosing to subsidize coal and nuclear, the Trump administration would be doing exactly what conservatives have accused the Obama administration of doing, choosing winners and losers in a free market energy economy. Still, against all odds, the Trump administration continues to push the president's agenda to save coal and reduce regulatory burdens on the fossil fuel industry. This week the Environmental Protection Agency announced it is repealing the Clean Power Plan, an Obama-era effort targeting emissions from coal-fired power plants. The renewable industry is awaiting a decision in coming weeks on whether the Trump administration will impose steep tariffs on imported solar panels. Taken together, these moves — if successful — could engineer a radical shift in direction for the U.S. energy industry.

Since then, the national crisis helpline has sought to bolster its resources for rural indigenous communities, like those of the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta.   StrongHearts representative Mallory Black, a member of the Navajo Nation herself, says that the helpline provides “culturally relevant, safe, and confidential resources,” for Alaska Natives and Native Americans.    “We can provide someone to talk to when you don’t have many people to turn to in your community,” said Black. “We can provide a Native advocate who comes from our communities, who understands the nuances of living in a rural Alaska Native village or can connect you with locally available resources.”   Initially, the StrongHearts Helpline service launched in Kansas, Oklahoma, and Nebraska. It has rapidly grown through its referral network over the past eight months. Coordinating with tribal communities, domestic violence programs, and other supportive resources, Black says that the project's culturally tailored support can be effective.    “Our advocates are available Monday through Friday from 7 a.m. to 3:30 p.m., Alaska Time,” said Black. “Our phone number is 1-844-7-N-A-T-I-V-E (1-844-762-8483).”   The National Indigenous Women’s Resource Center, or NIWRC, and the National Domestic Violence Hotline are partners with StrongHearts Native Helpline. The organizations are making a joint effort to lead the charge in beginning to address the country's long-overlooked crisis of violence against Alaska Native and Native American victims of domestic assault.   It’s because of this that Tundra Women’s Coalition Executive Director Eileen Arnold says that it is important to add this hotline to the list of available resources for crisis response.   “And I think it’s going to attract certain people to hear, like, ‘Wow, like, a national native hotline.’ I think that’s going to attract some people and sort of make that safer,” said Arnold. “If it’s national, the chances of you talking to someone you might know or might be related to are lessened.”   In terms of other resources that provide indigenous cultural perspectives around healing from domestic violence, Arnold says that the Healthy Families courses provided by YKHC, ONC, and AVCP are great resources, but that they all focus on what happens further down the line from the crisis.    “I do think we should have more crisis response available, but we’re limited right now,” said Arnold. “You know, the state of Alaska budgets are tight, so I don’t foresee any growth right now, which is another reason why this new resource is so excellent.”    Resources for the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta:   StrongHearts Native Helpline: 1-844-7-N-A-T-I-V-E or (1-844) 762-8483   Tundra Women’s Coalition: (Crisis Line) 1-800-478-7799, &amp; (907) 543-3456   Emmonak Women's Shelter: (907) 949-1443   Healthy Families Center: (907) 543-6000

Can you just describe what it's like in Santa Rosa right now? LOWENTHAL: Fortunately the temperatures are down. Winds are fairly calm. However, it's extremely smoky. It's pretty socked in. But given what we experienced a couple of days ago, we'd take this any time. We transitioned from very dry, extremely windy conditions that fanned this fire and created a pretty substantial level of destruction in the city of Santa Rosa to kind of a calm, eerie, smoky condition throughout the city. MCEVERS: Can we technically say that the fire has been contained at this point? LOWENTHAL: Oh, no, not at all. The weather conditions have substantially calmed from what they were when the fire started. We went from fanning a fire that was throwing ember and debris to the point where visibility was next to none to definitely not sunny out. But we can at least see the sun through the smoke - kind of a eerie, orange sky. MCEVERS: And how would you describe the scope of the fire itself? I mean, is it out of the ordinary for Santa Rosa to see a fire like this? LOWENTHAL: It's out of the ordinary for Santa Rosa, absolutely. We in the fire service are used to responding to large-scale wildfires around California regularly through the fire season. But never do we think that we're going to respond to one in our own backyard. It's pretty devastating. I'm looking at blocks and blocks of homes, entire neighborhoods, mobile home parks, hotels, restaurants, commercial buildings, warehouses and everything in between completely destroyed. We recognize the fact that this has been a pretty hard hit to the city of Santa Rosa. But we're a resilient community. We're a resilient county. And we're going to get through this. The fire department isn't here just to put the fire out. We're in this one for the long haul. Not only has our community been affected. But our firefighters have been affected. MCEVERS: Yeah. LOWENTHAL: We're looking at upwards of seven or eight firefighters that we know of whose homes were destroyed while we're battling this fire and continue to battle this fire, including my own. But right now the focus is on the community, getting the fire out and doing our job. And then we'll all get through this and help with the recovery process. MCEVERS: Yeah.

LOWENTHAL: So as the fire gets contained and percentage of containments go up and acres stop increasing, you're going to see both the city and the county coming together based on the sheer volume of structures that have been lost to start working on assistance, helping coordinate cleanups, debris removal, damage assessment. There's a lot of elements that are offered by both the city and county that'll work collectively to help all the different communities with that recovery process.

npr,"October 19, 2017",Custom-Printed Cocktails On The Moon? 'Soonish' Shows Us How," Hardcover, 358 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? Here's hoping that within 50 years or so, Kelly and Zach Weinersmith's book Soonish becomes hopelessly obsolete. As we lounge in our self-adjusting hammocks on the moon, reading our daily reports about which asteroids our robots are mining, our matter-printer might produce another round of fancy cocktails. Meanwhile, helpful nanobots will install our new 3-D printed livers to make sure all that drinking doesn't mess with our metabolisms. And we'll smile at each other and say, ""Remember that book from 2017 that predicted all this? Can you believe there was actually a time when we didn't have infinite fusion energy powering the space elevator that got us up here?"" Granted, none of this is likely within 50 years. But scientists are working on all of it right now. The Weinersmiths' Soonish: Ten Emerging Technologies That'll Improve and/or Ruin Everything lays out where these projects are right now, and what the upsides and downsides would be if they fully succeeded. From food printers that sound like the Star Trek replicators to fleets of tiny spider-robots, researchers are working to develop new programs and processes that seem like pure science fiction — just as technologies we take for granted today would look like science fiction to people 50 years ago. Dr. Kelly Weinersmith is a bioscience researcher studying parasites at Rice University. Her husband Zach is the artist behind the web comic Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal, a lively regular strip that finds immature humor in mathemetical concepts, mature humor in childhood stories, and random humor in topics from biology to art to politics to the sex lives of new parents. Their voices make a natural pairing in Soonish, which addresses heady scientific concepts in an accessible, readable way, with occasional dives into straight-faced, even grim absurdism. (On the legal issues of asteroid mining: ""Once the technology comes along to make capturing these asteroids and extracting their resources easier, no doubt we'll end up with space-crime by space-criminals. As cool as this sounds, you might not feel great about it if you're the one with a space-knife in your space-back."") In spite of this mild goofery, and Zack's one-panel color comics adding frequent punchlines, Soonish is mostly serious and informative. The Weinersmiths examine emerging technologies from gene editing to brain interfaces, and talk to researchers and scientists to see what the most cutting-edge experiments in the field look like. Their explanations are full of useful factoids — for instance, one of the biggest barriers to building space structures is that the average cost of getting cargo into orbit is about $10,000 per pound. But Soonish doesn't rely on head-scratching trivia as bland entertainment. The authors expand and expound on this information at length, springboarding into how different engines and rockets work, and how reusable rocket stages, or a space elevator, might shift the balance. From there, they expand to consider how cheap space flight could affect everything from climate change to war. 'Soonish' feels like an inviting primer on current scientific technology. But it also feels like a slightly drunken lecture by a couple of enthusiastic professors. The approach sounds programmatic, as they break down each technology under the headers ""Where are we now?"", ""Concerns,"" and ""How it would change the world."" But the Weinersmiths indulge themselves in Soonish, wandering down any rabbit trails that engage them, from 3-D printed alcoholic Jell-o shots to elaborate metaphors about immense cat-spheres and nerd social habits. And they periodically make themselves and their marriage the butt of their jokes. Soonish feels like an inviting primer on current scientific technology. But it also feels like a slightly drunken lecture by a couple of enthusiastic professors who keep tripping over each other to bring up this super-weird study about students obeying broken robots in an emergency situation. Soonish doesn't lean too far into utopianism. It's practical about the likelihood of any of these technologies actually working, and about humanity's high chances of messing everything up. But the book still suggests a bright, shining future. It may be shiny because we've all been replaced by murder-bots, or because we're all living in augmented reality. Soonish makes The Matrix seem surprisingly plausible, Keanu Reeves aside. But it leaves plenty of room for all sorts of outcomes. Part of the benefit of the book is that it doesn't promise we'll all be sipping printed cocktails on the moon in 2067. The Weinersmiths just lay out, clearly and with a wry sense of humor, exactly what it might take to get us there.

npr,N/A,Music In The Making: Coffee & Classical," Two caffeinated works by Beethoven. On this week’s episode, we’re celebrating National Coffee Day, which occurred this past week. We’ll hear two works by Beethoven, a composer who was as obsessive about his coffee as he was his music: allegedly, he counted out precisely 60 beans to brew his morning cup. Beethoven: Sonata in C Major, Op. 102 No. 1 The Fischer Duo 11/3/2006 Duncan Recital Hall The Cello Sonata in C Major was written in 1815, at the very beginning of the composer’s late period. During this era of compositional output, Beethoven continued to push boundaries, further exploring the chamber music genre and often eschewing standard formal designs. Both of these traits are seen in this sonata, a collaborative duo between cello and piano, which is divided into an unusual two movements, each with a slower introduction. Beethoven: Symphony No. 2 Shepherd School Chamber Orchestra 4/19/2012 Stude Concert Hall Composed in 1802, the second symphony is contemporaneous with the composer’s moment of severe crisis, chronicled in his Heiligenstadt Testament. In this document, Beethoven writes of his depression due to his increasing deafness. Despite this dark background, the second symphony is surprisingly lighthearted in nature, outgoing, and full of energy, certainly not a musical reflection of his despair.

npr,"October 26, 2017",Court To Rule On Whether Relapse By An Addicted Opioid User Should Be A Crime," Julie Eldred is back at home in Massachusetts now. But she was sentenced to a treatment program for opioid addiction as part of a probation agreement, then sent to jail when she relapsed. Some addiction specialists say that's unjust. Julie Eldred has been struggling with addiction to opioids for more than a decade and she says the criminal justice system punishes her for it. Eldred, a part-time pet caretaker in Acton, Mass., was put on probation last year for theft. She knew staying drug-free would be tough — especially at first, when she was going through opioid withdrawal. But, she says, she didn't have much of a choice. ""I was in the midst of active addiction, so I was actively using. But you're forced to go into this saying I'll be drug-free or you go to jail,"" Eldred says. She complied with her probation conditions, she says — she found outpatient treatment, addiction medication and a therapist — but she failed a drug test. Eldred told her probation officer that she had just started treatment and had relapsed, but was now back on track. Eldred says her probation officer didn't care. ""She didn't look at that picture,"" Eldred says. ""She didn't look [to see] that I had just gotten started getting everything in order. She just saw that I had a 'dirty urine,' and she just sent me in front of the judge to go to jail."" The judge sentenced Eldred to jail for the probation violation; Eldred says she received no treatment. ""I had a cellmate in there for murder, but she wasn't sentenced yet,"" Eldred says. ""You're with people who know they're going to be sentenced and they know they're going to be in there a long time, so they don't care. There is a lot of violence — girls will jump you. It's scary."" Ten days later, Eldred was released from jail when her lawyer found a bed in a residential treatment facility. That lawyer — Lisa Newman-Polk — brought Eldred's case to Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, arguing that the courts should not punish people for having the disease of addiction. ""This idea that a court can order a person to stop using — with the threat of punishment — is not grounded in reality,"" Newman-Polk says. ""If it worked to punish people for addiction and relapse we would have a cured nation."" Newman-Polk argues that courts should take into account scientific research about addiction, and apply it in practice — much as courts have done with the science about brain development and juvenile offenders. She says addiction is a medical condition, so it's unconstitutional to incarcerate someone for relapsing — because that's part of the disease. ""An order to be drug-free is an order that a person with a substance use disorder needs to be in remission or cured of addiction. It's not practical or reasonable, in view of what we know about the brain science and what we know about addiction,"" Newman-Polk says. The science of addiction is mentioned in all the legal briefs filed in this case — many focus on what research says about how much control patients like Eldred have over their drug use, and whether consequences like jail actually motivate patients to stop using. A brief from the Massachusetts Medical Society says relapse is a symptom of addiction that needs to be treated, not punished. ""Even Lindbergh bounced down the runway a couple of times before he became airborne,"" says Massachusetts Medical Society President Dr. Henry Dorkin, ""and we would not want to incarcerate people at the first sign of relapse if we're treating this as a chronic disease."" But the opposing briefs argue that there is not consensus about whether addiction is a brain disease that leaves someone powerless over drug use. The National Association of Drug Court Professionals says supervision and drug testing help keep people in recovery. It says specialty drug courts are effective and already work to get help for addicted defendants, rather than incarcerate them. It warns the Massachusetts court not to allow ""any particular theory of addiction to influence its decision."" 
                Eldred, at home with her dog, Bubbles, says she's committed to her recovery from opioid addiction. ""But,"" she adds, ""I can't say that I won't ever relapse again. Right now I feel strong, but this is a lifelong journey.""

 Eldred, at home with her dog, Bubbles, says she's committed to her recovery from opioid addiction. ""But,"" she adds, ""I can't say that I won't ever relapse again. Right now I feel strong, but this is a lifelong journey."" One of those writing on that side is Gene Heyman, a senior lecturer in psychology at Boston College. He cites studies that say that many people stop using drugs and alcohol on their own — oftentimes because they face negative consequences if they don't. ""The empirical question at stake is, if you ask someone not to use drugs and you provide a reason not to use, can the person respond ?"" Heyman says. ""And the data say yes they can — they can stop using drugs."" The Massachusetts attorney general points out that Eldred was on probation for theft — and that she did eventually go into drug treatment because otherwise she would go to jail. During the state's supreme court hearing on the case this month, the justices asked tough questions of both sides. Justice Barbara Lenk asked Newman-Polk where judges should draw the line if someone can't control their behavior. ""Now, if somebody didn't have the ability to resist the urge to use drugs, how is it that she could resist the urge to commit other petty crimes in order to support her drug habit ? How is it that she could have the self-control to continue in a treatment program that presumably doesn't want her to use drugs?"" Lenk asked. Crimes should be punished, Newman-Polk responded, but committing crimes is not a symptom of addiction. Maria Granik, a Massachusetts assistant attorney general, argued for the state, saying that addiction is not a defense for a probation violation or for criminal responsibility in general. Granik also argued that incarceration is one tool judges can use if necessary. But what if a judge decided to use the probation violation to sentence Eldred for the underlying crime of larceny, Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court Chief Justice Ralph Gantz asked Granik. ""What you need to come to grips with — and I don't hear it frankly,"" Gantz went on, ""is, is it appropriate for a judge under these circumstances, recognizing that relapse routinely occurs in these circumstances, to impose a two-and-a-half-year sentence in the House of Correction for her probation violation?"" ""I don't think we could go that far,"" Granik answered. Gantz says the high court will likely issue guidelines for all courts so judges can determine how to handle what has become a revolving door in the criminal justice system for those addicted. ""This is a really challenging issue, and each side needs to come to grips with it, because judges have to do this each and every day,"" Gantz says. The Massachusetts Bar Association expects the high court's ruling will cause state lawmakers to fund more addiction treatment. Martin Healy, the association's chief legal counsel and chief operating officer, believes the ruling will set a precedent. ""It is probably going to be one of the most important cases that our court will bring down — over the last decade,"" Healy says. ""And I think it will result in some dramatic changes to the way that society treats addiction.""  As for Julie Eldred, she is no longer on probation and says she's committed to working on her recovery. ""Hopefully this is it,"" Elred says. ""But I can't say that I won't ever relapse again. Right now I feel strong, but this is a lifelong journey. Some people think you get clean and that should be it. It's not."" A ruling from Massachusetts highest court is expected by spring.

RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:  Three U.S. physicists have been awarded this year's Nobel Prize in physics. They won the award for building a remarkable device that can detect something called gravitational waves. Here to tell us more about the award and give us a short physics lesson is NPR's science correspondent Joe Palca. Hey, Joe. JOE PALCA, BYLINE: Hey. MARTIN: I don't know how short the physics lesson is going to be if we're going to talk about gravitational waves. That sounds complicated. PALCA: It's - it's - it's going to be very short. But basically, this is one of those chances where I get to say something that sounds like science fiction but it's actually real. MARTIN: OK. PALCA: Gravitational waves are - like to be referred to as - well, they don't, but people like to refer to them as - ripples in space time. Don't you love that? Ripples in space time. They were predicted a hundred years ago by a chap named Albert Einstein. And when he wrote the theory of general relativity, basically he came to the conclusion that space, rather than being a flat thing, was curved and that the consequences of thinking of space as a curved thing, it came - out of that came this notion that there were something called gravitational waves. And you can think of it as a smooth surface where occasionally there are ripples, and the ripples are cause for cataclysmic events like black holes colliding or neutron stars colliding. And he said, these must exist, but we'll never detect them, that's - they're too faint. MARTIN: But they did. PALCA: But they did. MARTIN: But people did. Who are the people who did? PALCA: The people who did, well, they built a machine called LIGO, and their names are Rainer Weiss, from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Kip Thorne and Barry Barish from the California Institute of Technology. So we have MIT and Cal Tech. And they built an instrument called LIGO, the laser interferom - interferometer gravitational wave observatory. MARTIN: (Laughter) You almost didn't get it out, for good reason. PALCA: Yeah. No. It's tricky. But anyway, what it is is, it's basically two measuring sticks (laughter) 4 km long at right angles to one another. So it's like an L, right? MARTIN: Yeah. PALCA: And when a gravitational wave comes along, the length - the ripples in space time cause the length of these arms to change by the tiniest amount. And I mean tiny. We're talking atomic-scale changes in length. MARTIN: Yeah. PALCA: And the way you detect that is you shoot a laser beam back and forth, back and forth, back and forth down the - down the length of these things, and using a technique called interferometry, you can tell whether the laser beams are in sync, which means the two arms of the same length are slightly out of sync which means they've changed in length slightly. MARTIN: So what does it mean? I mean, what does it mean for us that they found these waves? PALCA: Oh, gosh. Well... MARTIN: How's that for a big question? PALCA: So listen, I got to go soon. MARTIN: (Laughter). PALCA: (Laughter). What it means is that there's a whole field of physics and astronomy that have been silent up until now. I mean, nobody actually could detect directly the collision of two black holes before. So the universe is suddenly much richer because we have this technique, this technology to detect these. And LIGO was just the first. There's another one that just started operating called Virgo. There's others that are going to be coming online. And so suddenly - and this is the great thing - there's a new device that's going to be able to make detections of things in the universe that nobody knows. MARTIN: So we can ask more questions. PALCA: You can have me back and I'll tell you, gosh, we never knew this was here, but there it is. So it's one of those crazy things where it's just going to change - it's going to change our world, which is - you can't say that about many discoveries, but this is really one of the more - one of these inventions which they did. MARTIN: All right. NPR's Joe Palca talking about the three American physicists who are awarded this year's Nobel Prize in Physics for detecting gravitational waves. Hey, Joe, thanks so much for the physics lesson. PALCA: You're welcome. Copyright © 2017 NPR.  All rights reserved.

npr,"October 13, 2017",How The Systemic Segregation Of Schools Is Maintained By 'Individual Choices'," This is FRESH AIR. I'm David Bianculli, editor of the website TV Worth Watching, sitting in for Terry Gross. Earlier this week, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation announced this year's recipients of its annual fellowship, a generous cash award commonly referred to as the genius grant. Today's guest is one of those recipients. She's Nikole Hannah-Jones, a staff writer for The New York Times Magazine. She covers what she sometimes describes as the segregation beat. For the Times and before that as a reporter for ProPublica, she has investigated why schools remain segregated or have even become resegregated. She's also written about housing segregation and how in the north, it was partly engineered by local and federal government policies. And she's written about how housing discrimination has led to or reinforced school segregation. She recently wrote about why she chose to send her daughter to her neighborhood public school, which is largely attended by low-income black and Latino students. Nikole Hannah-Jones won a Peabody Award for her story on This American Life about a school district in Missouri, the most racially segregated school district in the state. It's where Michael Brown went to school. Eight days after his high school graduation, Michael was killed by a police officer in Ferguson. Terry Gross spoke to Nikole Hannah-Jones earlier this year. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST) TERRY GROSS, BYLINE: Nikole Hannah-Jones, welcome to FRESH AIR. So school segregation is an issue you've covered and investigated, it's also an issue you've had to confront as a parent. You live in Bedford-Stuyvesant, a neighborhood of Brooklyn, which you describe as a low-income, heavily black, rapidly gentrifying neighborhood of brownstones. So what was the choice you were confronted with when it was time to send your daughter to school? NIKOLE HANNAH-JONES: Well, as your listeners may or may not know, New York City is one of the top three most segregated cities in the country, and its school system is among the most racially and economically segregated school systems - large school systems in the entire country as well. So while as a reporter I have been cataloging the harms of school segregation and kind of the necessity of integration, I had done that most of my career, not as a parent but as a journalist. And then we moved to New York City, my daughter is turning 4, and we have to decide where we're going to enroll her in schools. I live in a segregated neighborhood. The schools in my neighborhood are extremely segregated, both by poverty and by race. And so my husband and I had to decide if we were going to enroll her in one of the schools - types of schools that I write about, or if we were going to use our privilege, like many middle-class parents, and try to get her into a school that was less poor and less segregated. GROSS: So assuming that the school - assuming if you used your privilege, you could have gotten your child into a school that had better scores and achievement and everything and more resources for students, why did you choose to keep your daughter in the public school that had fewer resources? HANNAH-JONES: I think for me it was a couple of things. One, I know enough about the research to - that I knew that my daughter would actually be fine in that school. So the research shows that higher income families who go into high-poverty schools, the education of their students - their children does not suffer. So I knew that. But I also really believed that it was important for me to live my values. One of the things I've done in my work is kind of show the hypocrisy of progressive people who say they believe in inequality, but when it comes to their individual choices about where they're going to live and where they're going to send their children, they make very different decisions. And I just didn't want to do that. I felt morally that was not the right thing to do. And I also think it was - that it is important to understand that the inequality we see - school segregation is both structural, it is systemic, but it's also upheld by individual choices. As long as individual parents continue to make choices that only benefit their own children, you can support equality as a principle all you want, but we're not going to see a change. And so for me, it was a matter of needing to live my values and not being someone who contributed to the inequality that I write about. GROSS: So the school - the public school that you sent your daughter to, there were a lot of the things you liked about that school, including a lot of the teachers, and things were going pretty well. But then another elementary school, P.S. 8, which was less than a mile from the school your daughter was going to, that other school was overcrowded. This school - the overcrowded school - was in an affluent neighborhood, Brooklyn Heights. So how did the Department of Education deal with the overcrowding in the more affluent school? HANNAH-JONES: So what's interesting is the school that we ultimately sent our daughter to is located in an area that had seen a rapid demographic shift. And it had gone from an area that was fairly industrial and only had - the only people who lived there were people who lived in public housing projects, to a place where a lot of new housing had been built. And most of the new housing, the people living in that housing were white and they were very, very affluent. And so their neighborhood school was actually my daughter's school, many of them, but they weren't sending their children to their neighborhood school. They were sending their children to that school a mile away, P.S. 8, which had already turned into a majority white, very wealthy school. And because of that and because of how - schools where - that start to see a white population tend to attract large numbers of white parents, that school was very overcrowded. That school was considered the only option - public option for people in the surrounding area. So the Department of Education New York City, after continuing to cram so many students into that building, finally decided they weren't going to admit any more new students, and they weren't going to expand kindergarten for new incoming students. And instead, those students were to come to P.S. 307, which was my daughter's school. So they weren't doing an intentional integration plan, they really were dealing with severe overcrowding at one school. And my daughter's school, which is also very common, being a poor black and Latino school, was severely under-enrolled. We had plenty of space. But of course, nothing is ever that simple. GROSS: Right. So what was the reaction of parents who were told that they couldn't get their children into the more affluent school and they were going to be sent to the school your daughter was in? HANNAH-JONES: Well, those parents were not happy at all. They called their elected officials and they began holding meetings and they went to the press and really revolted against the Department of Education's decision to send their children to that school. There were several pretty ugly meetings. And at that time, I was not sitting in these meetings as a journalist. I had no intention of writing about this issue. I think it's important not to necessarily report a personal story on the beat that you cover. So I was just sitting in these meetings as a parent who was interested to hear what people who could potentially be coming to my daughter's school had to say about it. And it was hurtful to hear the things that parents were saying, particularly these are parents who are progressive. They live in Brooklyn because they say that they believe in diversity, often held up as being these kind of hipster people who don't see race. And I was hearing the same thing from those parents that I had heard in Tuscaloosa, Ala. It was no different. GROSS: You said that some of the things that were said at these meetings were hurtful to you. What were some of those things? HANNAH-JONES: Well, there was lots of questions and concerns about safety. Keep in mind, these are elementary school children. These are very young kids. And there were questions about, you know, they believed our school was dangerous. They believed the children were dangerous. It wasn't that they didn't want to go to school with black kids, it's just that these kids were poor and they don't want their children around so many poor children. They talked about the achievement of the students. So our school does have very low test scores, and so they believe that their kids will be dumbed down if they came to school with our children. There was not an acknowledgment that these children were even part of the same community as them, even though many of them lived across the street from the school and lived across the street from the housing projects that these children lived in. So I think to hear those concerns - with no evidence. The school is not a dangerous school. There were rumors about, you know, guns, just all kinds of things that clearly showed a racial fear. And talking about our community, our community, as if these children and their families were not members of that community. And I actually stood up at one of those meetings as a 307 parent and I told them - the P.S. 8 parents - if you don't want to come to our school, that's fine. But you don't have to slander the children in the school because you don't want to come there. So, you know, make your objections known. But I think that language and to think that the families at 307 weren't hearing what their neighbors were saying about them was naive. I mean, people knew and it was very hurtful. GROSS: Now, you write during this debate about what to do during the objections that were raised by the parents who didn't want to send their children to your child's school, that each group - white, black, middle-class, poor - had their own concerns. What were some of the other concerns that were expressed, and what were your concerns? HANNAH-JONES: So the concerns on the part of the parents at P.S. 307, my daughter's school, was one, of course there are a lot of bruised feelings when you had people who were talking so terribly about your children and the education and what was happening in the school who were now supposed to be coming to that school. So parents really wanted the DOE to facilitate some kind of coming together of these two communities so that they could talk through those things and that there wouldn't be tensions if those parents did come into the school. But I think the biggest concern was there is a pattern in New York City of once a school is targeted for white expansion, that school very quickly flips. And this is what happened at P.S. 8, the overcrowded school, where these schools that are targeted are typically very high-functioning segregated schools. So they're not rezoning white children into failing segregated schools. They're rezoning them into schools that are actually serving black and Latino children pretty well. And then there's a fear that then those parents come in and they take over and that the little power that these marginalized communities have in their school, they lose. And ultimately, the black and Latino populations are pushed out of those schools. So there was a huge fear that this school that was doing a rare thing, which was serving poor black and Latino children well, would very quickly not be their school anymore and that those children would be sent away or crowded out of the school. GROSS: OK, so this is a dilemma right here. If integration is a goal, to have more diversity and to have more fair schools, and here is something that's going to integrate a school not for the sake of integration but because of overcrowding - but still, it would be more integration - and everybody has concerns, everybody's worried about the outcome - so what does that say about the predicament that parents and schools are in? HANNAH-JONES: What I always say is we somehow want this to be easy and simple, and it never will be. The systems that and the actions that created this inequality took a lot of effort and a lot of time. And we want to undo them, you know, with no pain for anyone with a snap of the fingers. On my Twitter account, I say - I cover race from 1619. And 1619 is the year the first Africans were brought to what would become America as - to be enslaved. I say that so that we understand there is a very - before we were even a country, we had created this system that was going to put black people on the bottom and we created a caste system. And to undo that, we feel like no one has to give anything up or there's not going to be any tension or it's going to be easy, and it simply won't. One of the things that I really try to do with my work is show how racial segregation and racial inequality was intentionally created with a ton of resources. From the federal government, to the state, to city governments, to private citizens, we put so much effort into creating the segregation and inequality, and we're willing to put almost no effort in fixing it. And that's the problem. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Nikole Hannah-Jones. She writes about racial injustice for The New York Times Magazine. It's what she sometimes calls the segregation beat. We'll talk more after we take a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF DIGABLE PLANETS' ""REBIRTH OF SLICK"") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview with Nikole Hannah-Jones. She covers racial injustice for The New York Times Magazine and has written extensively about why so many schools and neighborhoods today are segregated. So you've described your daughter's school as a high-functioning kind of segregated black school, and most of the children in the school are low income. So if everybody has to make a sacrifice of some sort and if it's going to be painful all the way around to really integrate the schools, do you feel like you're making a sacrifice sending your daughter to this school because you're standing on the principle that you want to send your daughter to a public school and not put your daughter into a more - a school reserved for more privileged people? Do you feel like you're sacrificing anything in her life, the quality of her education, the resources that she'd have in a better school? HANNAH-JONES: Yeah. You know, I really grapple with this in the piece I wrote. And I'm quite honest about the arguments and conversations my husband and I had about this decision because I know better than most how segregated schools harm children. That's why I write about them the way that I do. But I think what is important for us as citizens of this country to think about is what do we see as the role of public schools? If - do we truly believe in the original mission of public schools and that they are to benefit all children, and they aren't to - you know, it's not the market. It's not private schools. It is this understanding that no matter where you come from, you will go into the doors of a school and every child will receive the same education. And, no, I'm not going to - my daughter is not going to get an education that she would get if I paid $40,000 a year in private school tuition. But that's kind of the whole point of public schools. I think she - I know she's learning a lot. I think it is making her a good citizen. I think it is teaching her that children who have less resources than her are not any less intelligent than her, are not any less worthy than her. And I truly - and I say this - and it always feels weird when I say it as a parent because a lot of other parents look at you a little, you know, like you're maybe not as good of a parent - I don't think she's deserving of more than other kids. I just don't. I think that we can't say this school is not good enough for my child and then sustain that system. I think that that's just morally wrong. If it's not good enough for my child, then why are we putting any children in those schools? So I would say I have concerns. I'm not everyday sure that I'm making the right decision for her. Am I being fair to my daughter? But I think that I can provide my daughter anything that she's not going to get in that public school. I have the money to pay for tutoring. I take my daughter to museums. I expose her to writers who come to my house all of the time. And it is important for us to be in that school because we are able then to provide some of that for classmates whose parents are not going to have writers and business owners and journalists in their home. So I think that that is what is so critical is do we really believe in the public part of public schools? GROSS: Let me quote something you say in your New York Times piece about this. You write (reading) true integration, true equality requires a surrendering of advantage. And when it comes to our own children, that can feel almost unnatural. So what's the feeling that - a natural feeling part of the equation for you? Do you feel like it's unnatural to surrender the advantage that your child has? HANNAH-JONES: Of course. I mean, I worked to get where I am so that I could provide things for my child that my parents couldn't. And one of the few advantages that my parents were able to provide for me was to enroll me in a bussing program that got me out of my segregated schools and into high-achieving, more affluent white schools. And I am not doing that for my own child. So I think it is the most natural thing in the world for parents to try to secure advantage for their own children. And to try to give up that advantage or tell people to give up that advantage is a hard ask. I understand. But at the same time, I don't think that she is going to be harmed by this. I think that it is only a sacrifice if you really believe that those kids are less than yours. And I don't think that that's true. With that said, one of the main reasons I write so much about segregation is because we do know that our country's education system was built on a racial caste and that once we isolate black and Latino children or poor children away from white and middle-class children, we often don't give them the same resources. They often don't have the same level of instruction. They often don't have strong principals. They often don't have the same technology. I mean, federal data shows that. So my daughter's school is rare in that way, and I think where we see... GROSS: In that is does have better resources than the average... HANNAH-JONES: It does. GROSS: ...Low-income, racially segregated school. HANNAH-JONES: Right. But almost entirely because of a principal who was there named Roberto Davenport (ph). And when you look at these schools, it is - if they are high-functioning, it is almost always because of a single charismatic principal. And that's just not a way to get systemic equality. So I think that that is - the problem is school integration and integration in neighborhoods is not about some feel-good notion. It really is about - there's never been a moment in the history of this country where black people who have been isolated from white people have gotten the same resources, not in schools, not in communities. And, you know, Dr. King understood that in a visceral way that integration was about the sharing of power and it was about full citizenship. And I believe that. BIANCULLI: Nikole Hannah-Jones speaking to Terry Gross earlier this year. She was just awarded a MacArthur genius grant for her writing about segregation and racism in education and in housing. After a break, we'll continue their conversation and film critic Justin Chang will review the new Noah Baumbach movie, ""The Meyerowitz Stories."" I'm David Bianculli, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF JOHN COLTRANE'S ""SYEEDA'S SONG FLUTE"") BIANCULLI: This is FRESH AIR. I'm David Bianculli in for Terry Gross back with more of Terry's interview from earlier this year with New York Times Magazine staff writer Nikole Hannah-Jones. Her beat focuses on racism in housing and education. She was just awarded a MacArthur Foundation genius grant for exceptional work, a cash award of $625,000 with no strings attached. Nikole Hannah-Jones lives in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Bedford-Stuyvesant and has chosen to send her daughter to the neighborhood public school, which is primarily attended by low-income black and Latino students. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST) GROSS: So we were talking about how you've chosen to keep your daughter in a public school and not send her to a private school or a school for gifted children. Your parents made the opposite decision. When you were in first grade and you went to a school that you described as poor and distressingly chaotic, your parents decided to take you out of that school and sign you up for a voluntary busing program that sent you to a different school. What was the school you were sent to? HANNAH-JONES: I was sent to Kingsley Elementary in Waterloo, Iowa, and it was quite far from my home. It was almost entirely white and a very wealthy school. GROSS: After you became an adult and after you started covering school segregation, did you ask your mother, adult to adult, why she decided to send you into that voluntary busing program to a more affluent white school? HANNAH-JONES: I did. You know, it's funny. At the time, when I was a kid, I didn't realize I was part of a busing program. I always say, you know, as a kid, you do what your parents tell you to do. And my parents told me to get on a bus and go to this school. And that's what I did. And it wasn't until I was much older, and I started writing about school segregation myself that I realized that - what this program was designed to do and that my hometown had to enter into an agreement with the Department of Education to do this voluntary desegregation program. So I didn't realize it. I just knew that I used to be able to walk to school, and then all of a sudden, I was riding the bus for two hours a day. So as I started reporting, particularly this last story about my own daughter, which was the first time that I had really written about being in a busing program myself, I did ask my mom why did she decide to do that because I have very mixed feelings about my own experience. And I know from talking to a lot of other black folks my age who also went through busing programs that they also tend to have very mixed experiences because academically, it was transformative for me, but it was very, very difficult socially. So I did - I talked to my mom when I was writing the story that published in June about kind of her decision-making and why she picked this particular school, which was kind of the furthest away from us and also probably the whitest. And for her, you know, our - my family was very working-class. My mom was a probation officer. My dad drove a bus. And this was an advantage that they could give us. They both understood that my neighborhood school was not high-functioning, and this was the one thing they could give us was a good education. GROSS: You said academically, this school busing program worked for you really well, but socially, it was very problematic. What were the social problems you confronted? HANNAH-JONES: Well, one, not only were we black in a very white school, but we were working-class in a very affluent school. So I remember - I mean, things that stick out to me was all the white kids lived in the neighborhood. They walked to school. This was their school. The black kids came every day on a bus. And at the end of the day, when all of our friends were playing and walking home and hanging around on the jungle gym, we were having to hurry up and get loaded on a bus and head back to our neighborhoods. So it never felt like our school. And I was bused from second grade all the way until I graduated high school. And there were none of those schools that I went to that I felt were my schools because we were going to school in someone else's neighborhood. It always felt like those schools belonged to them. There was a particular incident when I was in middle school. And at that time, most of my friends were still white because there were hardly any black kids at the school. And I was in talented and gifted, so I hung out with a lot of the kids in talented and gifted. And in my hometown, there's a, quote, unquote, ""white side,"" which was the west side and all the black people lived on the east side. And we lived on the east side and were bused to the west side. And there was a swimming pool that served each side of town. And we used to always go and play and go swimming with my white friends at the swimming pool on their side of town. And one day, I suggested, hey, why don't you all come to the swimming pool on my side of town? And everyone was down with it. We were all excited. And then that Saturday morning, I got phone call after phone call from every one of my friends who was going to come telling me they couldn't come, that their parents wouldn't let them come to the pool on my side of town, but I was more than welcome to come to Bernes Park (ph), which was where the pool was on their side of town. And I just remember very clearly understanding what that was about, that my white friends' parents were either afraid or didn't think this was good enough. And so it was kind of constantly those types of things. I didn't ever experience really blatant racism, but it was always these things that were kind of telling you you didn't belong and you weren't good enough. GROSS: You write that the evidence shows that integration is really the only thing that improves the academic performance of low-income children of color. So what is that evidence? HANNAH-JONES: Well, you can look at test score data. You can look at - so there's both - so let me also be clear. Brown v. Board of Education never talks about test scores. We are hyper focused on test scores now. And the way that we have comforted ourselves with the segregation in schools is to say we're just going to get those schools' test scores up to par. Well, one, we haven't done that. But there are lots of measures of what schools are supposed to do. And, you know, when we found public schools in this country, it's not to get kids to have good test scores. So let me just say that. But what the data shows is we know if we're looking at test scores, if we're measuring the achievement gap, which is the test score gap between black and white students, that gap was the narrowest at the peak of integration in the school integration, which was 1988. As soon as we start to see the segregation increasing again, that achievement gap increases. And we've actually never gotten back to that low point that we were at when schools were their most integrated. But there's also great science out of University of California, Berkeley by a professor named Rucker Johnson that shows the longitudinal effects of school desegregation on black students. And what it showed is that it changed the entire trajectory of their lives, that it wasn't just about how well they scored on a test, that black students who went to integrated schools were less likely to be poor as adults, were more likely to go to college. They lived longer. They were healthier. And they passed this benefit onto their own children. And even within the same family, if one child remained in segregated schools and one child went to integrated schools, the child in the same family who went to integrated schools had these same lifelong effects. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Nikole Hannah-Jones. She covers racial injustice for The New York Times Magazine. We're going to take a short break. We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF THE MOUNTAIN GOATS SONG, ""PEACOCKS"") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview with Nikole Hannah-Jones. She covers racial injustice for The New York Times Magazine and has written extensively about why so many schools and neighborhoods today are segregated. When writing about the schools, you often use the word resegregation. What does that mean? HANNAH-JONES: So we had this period after Brown - so just a quick history lesson - Brown v. Board happens and kind of the way that we're taught it or the myth about it is immediately, our nation repented and, you know, went into an integrated future together. That's not what happened. There was massive resistance. And we don't see real desegregation occurring in this country until 1964 and really most rapidly from 1968 on. And then you see pretty rapid desegregation particularly in the South and - but then that changes. And in 1988, we start to go backwards. So we reach kind of the peak of schools integrating, of black students attending majority-white schools at the highest rates that they ever have in the country. And then we start to see school districts resegregating, which means black students are starting to go to schools that are more and more segregated. And school districts that had had a degree of integration are losing that integration. So what we know... GROSS: And why is that? Is that families moving, out is that rezoning, is it a combination of things? HANNAH-JONES: It's a bunch of things. Particularly, I think one of the big things was, again, most of the desegregation occurs in the South. And it occurs in the South because the South was segregated by law, and therefore the way that the courts have kind of determined desegregation law, you could get court orders to integrate. It was - been much more challenging to desegregate in the North, and there was a lot of resistance to desegregation in the North. So what happened is across the South, beginning under the Reagan administration but really speeding up under George W. Bush, was a release of many of these school districts from their federal desegregation orders, which meant that as long as these districts, once their court orders to integrate have been closed, they can do whatever they want as long as they don't say they're doing it to discriminate. So they can rezone to create all-black schools. They can build all-black schools. But as long as they don't say they're doing it to be discriminatory, it's actually perfectly legal. So that's a big part of it. White flight out of cities was a huge part of it. You had, you know, cities like New York and Philadelphia and Chicago that lost most of their white population. And so in the North, most school segregation is between school districts, between a urban school district and the suburbs that surround it. And so that contributed a lot to it as well. GROSS: Do you think people just take for granted nowadays that there's black schools and white schools, some schools are integrated, lots of schools aren't, there's black neighborhoods and white neighborhoods, some neighborhoods are integrated, lots of neighborhoods aren't and that's just the way it is? HANNAH-JONES: Absolutely. When I started what I kind of call the segregation beat about five years ago, no one was writing, really, about segregation. I think we had stopped talking about this as a problem. If you look at No Child Left Behind, which comes out of the Bush administration, that was all about giving up on integration in schools and just saying we're going to make these poor black and Latino schools equal to white schools by testing and accountability. So no one was discussing integration anymore. And I think it's because, one, we never really wanted it. If you look at the great civil rights legislation that gets passed in the '60s, the very last law that's passed is the Fair Housing Act, which gets passed in 1968. That was considered the northern civil rights bill. And that's why that was the toughest one. So the '64 Civil Rights Act - very successful. It would be very surprising if I were to try to walk into a cafe or go on a bus and be turned away because of my race. The Voting Rights Act was considered extremely successful. But the Fair Housing Act is the one that's considered the complete failure because that was going to integrate where we live. And by proxy, that would integrate schools. And Northern congressmen fought that the same way that Southern congressmen were fighting the other civil rights laws. And the only reason that law gets passed is Dr. King gets assassinated. A hundred cities riot - black, poor, segregated, Northern cities. And it's in the flames where there literally are rioters within feet of Capitol Hill that Congress manages to pass the Fair Housing Act. And then Nixon is elected and immediately runs on a Southern strategy where he says if you support me - and he's appealing to white Southerners and white Northern ethnics - that he will stop forward progress on school segregation and - school desegregation and housing integration. And that's what he does. So we never, as a country, wanted this. It's always had to be forced. And as soon as our country lost, you know, our elected officials and our courts lost the will to force it, most white Americans were just fine with that. I think what's important to understand is the North has been able to portray the South as the part of the country that has a race problem and is very comfortable with that. So the South enforced its racial code through laws. In the North, race and racial code and racial inequality was enforced through housing. So the North is the most segregated region of the country both for housing and for schools. And the North is no better on race than the South. It was just for most of the country, the black population in the North was very small. And as you start to see millions of black people migrating from the South starting in the early 1900s, suddenly the North is confronted with having to deal with black people and it doesn't do any better than the South. It creates ghettos, it redlines, it forces black people to stay in very small sectors of the city. So when you're looking at something like the Fair Housing Act, that is forcing Northerners to deal with their race issue. And Northerners are not any more willing to do that than Southerners were. When you look at how integrated schools are down South - and it is true, it was because of court order - you would not see white children in - it's rare to see white children in the Northern schools that integrated. And that's the problem is that there is no one who will be pushing for this. GROSS: Nikole Hannah-Jones, I want to thank you so much for talking with us and thank you for your work. HANNAH-JONES: Thank you so much. BIANCULLI: Nikole Hannah-Jones speaking to Terry Gross earlier this year. She just was awarded a MacArthur genius grant for her stories in The New York Times Magazine researching and uncovering endemic racism in education and housing. She helped found the Ida B. Wells Society for Investigative Reporting, which is dedicated to increasing the ranks of investigative reporters of color. We also want to recognize another MacArthur genius, singer and songwriter Rhiannon Giddens. She received her award for the many decades of music she's recorded with the Carolina Chocolate Drops and as a solo artist capturing African-American experiences and traditions and performing songs written from slave narratives and for civil rights leaders. This is from her solo album ""Freedom Highway."" (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""BETTER GET IT RIGHT THE FIRST TIME"") RHIANNON GIDDENS: (Singing) Young man was a good man, always went to school. Young man was a good man, never played the fool. Young man was a good man, never had no drama. Young man was a good man, always took care of his mama. Young man was a good man, hanging with his boys. Young man was a good man, didn't know he'd made a choice. Young man was a good man, only did it twice. Young man was a good man, but now he's paid the price. Better get it right the first time. Better get it right the first time. Better get it right the first time. Better get it right the first time. Young man was a good man, did you stand your ground? Young man was a good man, is that why they took you down? Young man was a good man, or did you run that day? Young man was a good man. Baby, they shot you anyway. Better get it right the fist time. Better get it right the first time. Better get it right the first time.

npr,"October 14, 2017","Saturday Sports: Baseball Playoffs, Men's U.S. Soccer Loss"," (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SIMON: Dallas and Houston shuts down New York. That's Dallas Keuchel of the Astros, who won game one against the Yanks. Cubs versus Dodgers tonight. And guess who's not going to the World Cup? We're joined now by Howard Bryant of espn.com and ESPN The Magazine. Howard, thanks so much for being with us. HOWARD BRYANT: Good morning, Scott. SIMON: New York, Chicago, LA, Houston - I - the first time I can recall the four largest cities in the country, in the United States, have been the four teams in the baseball playoffs. Is Major League Baseball delighted about possible matchups? BRYANT: Well, I think not only are they delighted about it because you've got those matchups, but they're also delighted with - apologies to our good friends in Houston. No offense because they are the better team, but, boy, you can tell that the executives at Major League Baseball can't wait for the possibility of a Yankees-Dodgers World Series; haven't had that since since Reggie Jackson and Fernando Valenzuela. The Dodgers haven't been to the World Series since 1988. Just the possibility of the Yankees and the Cubs in the World Series - one, the Cubs to repeat their championship, and two, the Yankees and the Cubs haven't played since Babe Ruth's called shot in 1932. SIMON: Yes. BRYANT: So there are all kinds of possibilities. And on top of that, to have the Houston Astros... SIMON: And we want revenge for that, by the way. BRYANT: (Laughter) You want revenge, exactly. And the Yankees haven't been to the World Series since the dark old days of 2009. But still, the matchups are unbelievable. The teams are great. And the Astros, as - everything we've seen from them during the regular season and in the postseason when they pretty much destroyed the Red Sox - everybody's good. And I think that the games are just going to be great. SIMON: Little, quick post-series analysis - a week ago, the Cleveland Indians looked like the best team in baseball. They won 22 straight during the regular season. Why didn't they get past the Yankees? BRYANT: Because baseball's hard. That's the first reason and because you just never have an idea of what's going to happen when you get out there. And everyone - there's going to be all kinds of postmortems and, boy, do I have a lot of respect for Tito Francona as such a professional in such a difficult, difficult loss. They went out. They won 22 games in a row this year. They lost the World Series in heartbreaking fashion, having a 3 games to 1 lead against the Cubs last year. They lose in game seven at home, and they were on a mission this year. And it looked to me like they ran out of gas. Corey Kluber, their ace, looked like he was injured, and he didn't really pitch very well in the series at all, either in game two or in the clincher in game five. So heartbreak in Cleveland for them to go another year a game away from winning a series and then losing three in a row - very, very difficult. SIMON: And the Cubs just nosed past the Washington Nationals. BRYANT: Yeah. SIMON: The Cubs, supposedly cursed for 108 years now, seem to have a lot of luck, as they did against the Nats, while people are beginning to suggest the Nats must have some kind of curse. BRYANT: Well, exactly, and also you talk about heartbreak - very difficult for Dusty Baker, one of the all-time great managers who's just never had that great success in the postseason. You know, they went to the World Series in 2002, lost that in heartbreaking fashion to the Angels. And he's 14th all time - in the all-time managerial wins list. But the postseason has been real difficult for that franchise. But on the other hand, let's also give some credit to the Cubs. Let's give some credit to the teams instead of talking about curses and everything else. Let's talk about getting out on the field in the tough moments and doing what you're supposed to do. And they came out, and Chicago proved that they're a championship team once more. But Dusty Baker doesn't have a contract, so there are going to be some implications. Hopefully they bring him back because he does not deserve to get fired after winning 95 and 97 games with this team. SIMON: And quickly, U.S. men's soccer team not going to the World Cup, although the U.S. women's team won the 2015 World Cup. What does this say about U.S. men's soccer? BRYANT: Well, it says that they've got problems just like in men's tennis. But the biggest thing it says to me is, could we please stop making it sound as if the sport is in trouble? The men's side is in trouble. The women are doing great - three World Cups for the women, and Venus and Serena have done their thing on the American side in tennis. SIMON: Howard Bryant of ESPN, thanks very much. BRYANT: My pleasure. Copyright © 2017 NPR.  All rights reserved.

npr,"Oct 27,  2017",Maine Senators Take Issue With Plan For Steep Hikes In National Park Fees," “If you end up stifling visitation to the parks, you could end up with less revenue than you had before, and one of my questions for the secretary is whether any economic analysis was done,” he says. In a letter to Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, King and Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine say they’re concerned that increasing park fees would make it more difficult for people to visit, and could hurt the economy of the communities around the park that depend on the seasonal revenue. “If you’re talking about a $70 fee, people are going to say, ‘Well I don’t know, maybe we’ll go to the state park or maybe we’ll stay home this year,’” King says. In the letter, King and Collins pointed out that the increase would likely only raise about $70 million a year. At the same time, the Park Service’s request for funding for this year cuts the annual budget for maintenance and operations by $270 million. Park advocacy groups say they are surprised by the new proposed fee increases for 17 of the National Park Service’s most popular sites, including Acadia. The NPS said in a written statement Tuesday that it is accepting public comments on its proposed new “peak season” fee of $70 per private, noncommercial vehicle. Weekly passes at Acadia are currently $25 and $50 for an annual entrance pass.

npr,N/A,WHYY," He stands at the top of the stairs, hands in pockets, waiting for visitors to come up. “Lot of steps, there,” he warns, before offering a reporter the overstuffed easy chair and a glass of water. Azoff still drives himself around town in a 2000 Toyota Camry (“It’s a great car”) without incident, although passengers note he sometimes forgets where he’s headed. He has been an avid, daily harmonica player since he bought his first instrument at age 12 — from money he earned by cleaning blood off butcher’s blocks — and he often spends time listening to music on an iPad. “Death. I expect it. When the ugly guy comes to get me, OK. So be it,” said Azoff. “I had a nice time. I had a good life — a beautiful wife, nice kids. What else is there?” Azoff has outlived his wife and one of his children (his son Mitchell died two years ago at age 65), but he will not outlive kidney failure. For over a year, he has been in home hospice care; most people last about 60 days in that situation. “I think the process has been stressful. He has been in hospice so long,” said Morgan Thompson, a hospice volunteer who visits Azoff once a week. “He has questions, ‘Why am I still here? I’m ready. I’m tired.’ He bounces back, sometimes by the next visit, he says, ‘I’m almost human today!’ That’s his favorite joke, ‘I’m almost human today.'” Recently, Thompson helped her own mother pass away. Now, when she and Azoff get together they crack jokes about dying. “When do you start making jokes? When it still stings,” said Thompson. “Like, when you put peroxide on a cut. You start making jokes when it still hurts, so the healing process starts.” Over the summer, while sitting under a tree in Queen Village, they hatched an idea to compile their jokes into a short, comic play. Called “Hospice-tality” (according to Thompson — Azoff claims there is no title), the 30-minute play was performed Thursday evening at the Penn Hospice Center in Rittenhouse Square by members of Philadelphia Improv Theater. The script is a series of interactions with a hospice patient and his team of caregivers. The jokes are broad, mostly one-liners sandwiched between observations about dying. The patient asks his visiting nurse: “Did you always dream of being a hospice nurse, or did it come to you in a nightmare?” It got a laugh, but Azoff isn’t expecting to win any awards. “I like things like slipping on a banana peel,” said Azoff. “It’s not funny anymore, but, when I was a kid, we would laugh like the Dickens when somebody slipped on a banana peel.” He may or may not write another script. In what time he has left, Azoff wants to learn to play the mandolin — his friends chipped in to buy him one. He’s waiting for some arthritis in his thumb to subside. Until then, he plays the harmonica every day, from Mozart to blues to pop. After the premiere of his play, he treated the audience to a version of “Let Me Go, Lover,” a hit for Joan Weber in 1954: Let me go,
Let me go,
Let me go, Lover.

npr,"October 25, 2017",All-Time High: Majority Of Republicans Support Pot Legalization For First Time," For the first time, a majority of Republicans are in favor of legalizing marijuana, according to a Gallup poll out Wednesday. Fifty-one percent of Republicans tell Gallup that, yes, marijuana should be legal, up from 42 percent last year. That support has led to a whopping two-thirds of Americans (64 percent) supporting pot legalization, the highest ever recorded by Gallup. Gallup has data on the question since 1969. How quickly has support for marijuana changed among Americans? In 2004, just over a third supported it. Roughly that many Democrats were in favor, and only 20 percent of Republicans were. Majority of REPUBLICANS for first time in favor of legalization pic.twitter.com/ajqyM6E3Ni What has changed? Half the country has moved toward marijuana legalization in some form — with more than a half-dozen states having legalized pot for recreational use and more than dozen others having legalized medical marijuana. (Governing has a good map of that.) As Gallup's Justin McCarthy notes, ""As efforts to legalize marijuana at the state level continue to yield successes, public opinion, too, has shifted toward greater support."" Yet, the Trump administration has taken a tack in the opposite direction. ""When you see something like the opioid addiction crisis blossoming in so many states around this country, the last thing we need to be doing is encouraging people,"" said then-White House press secretary Sean Spicer several months ago. ""There is still a federal law we need to abide by."" President Trump's attorney general, Jeff Sessions, has a long record of being no fan of marijuana. In the 1980s, his nomination for a federal judgeship was derailed, in part, because of the revelation that he had joked that he thought the KKK was ""OK until I found out they smoked pot."" As a senator, Sessions was very much set against marijuana, remarking during a hearing just last year: ""Good people don't smoke marijuana."" Of course, there is no guarantee that support stays at these levels, as NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben noted last year, especially if there are unintended consequences in the states where it's legal — and if as millennials get older and have children, they change their minds. But the trend in public opinion at this point is undeniable. NPR thanks our sponsors Become an NPR sponsor ",http://www.npr.org/559989879
npr,"October 24, 2017",Majority Of White Americans Say They Believe Whites Face Discrimination," A majority of whites say discrimination against them exists in America today, according to a poll released Tuesday from NPR, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. ""If you apply for a job, they seem to give the blacks the first crack at it,"" said 68-year-old Tim Hershman of Akron, Ohio, ""and, basically, you know, if you want any help from the government, if you're white, you don't get it. If you're black, you get it."" More than half of whites — 55 percent — surveyed say that, generally speaking, they believe there is discrimination against white people in America today. Hershman's view is similar to what was heard on the campaign trail at Trump rally after Trump rally. Donald Trump catered to white grievance during the 2016 presidential campaign and has done so as president as well. Notable, however, is that while a majority of whites in the poll say discrimination against them exists, a much smaller percentage say that they have actually experienced it. Also important to note is that 84 percent of whites believe discrimination exists against racial and ethnic minorities in America today. Loading... People from every racial or ethnic group surveyed said they believe theirs faces discrimination — from African-Americans and Latinos to Native Americans and Asian-Americans, as well as whites. The NPR, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health survey sampled 3,453 adults in the U.S. from Jan. 26 to April 9. Of those, 902 were white. The responses from whites can be broken down into three categories. Those who: 1. Believe there is anti-white discrimination and say they have personally experienced it, 2. Say there is indeed anti-white discrimination but say they have never felt it themselves, and 3. Say there is no discrimination of whites in America White and discriminated against? Ask Hershman whether there is discrimination against whites, and he answered even before this reporter could finish the question — with an emphatic ""Absolutely."" ""It's been going on for decades, and it's been getting worse for whites,"" Hershman contended, despite data showing whites continue to be better off financially and educationally than minority groups. Even though Hershman believes he has been a victim of anti-white discrimination, he wasn't able to provide a specific example. He describes losing out on a promotion — and a younger African-American being selected as one of the finalists for the job. But the position eventually went to a white applicant, who was also younger than Hershman. Discrimination exists, but never felt it Representing Category 2 is 50-year-old heavy equipment operator Tim Musick, who lives in Maryland, just outside Washington, D.C. He says anti-white discrimination is real, but he doesn't think he has ever really felt it personally. ""I think that you pretty much, because you're white, you're automatically thrown into that group as being a bigot and a racist and that somehow you perceive yourself as being more superior to everybody else, which is ridiculous,"" Musick said, speaking during his lunch break at a construction site. ""I'm just a man that happens to have been born white,"" Musick continued. He also makes it clear, however, that he is not comparing what happens to whites to the African-American experience. ""I don't know what it feels like to be a black man walking around in the streets, but I do know what it feels like to be pegged, because of how you look, and what people perceive just on sight,"" said Musick, who has the stocky build of a retired NFL lineman and a shaved head under his hard hat. Whites who don't believe they are discriminated against Now for the third category — those who scoff at the notion that whites face racial discrimination. That describes retired community college English teacher Betty Holton, of Elkton, Md. ""I don't see how we can be discriminated against when, when we have all the power,"" Holton said, chuckling in disbelief into her cellphone. ""Look at Congress. Look at the Senate. Look at government on every level. Look at the leadership in corporations. Look. Look anywhere."" Holton asserts: ""The notion that whites are discriminated against just seems incredible to me."" Perception based on income Income also seemed to affect individual responses to the question of discrimination. Lower- and moderate-income white Americans were more likely to say that whites are discriminated against — and to say they have felt it, either when applying for a job, raise or promotion or in the college-admissions process. ""We've long seen a partisan divide with Democrats more likely to say racial discrimination is that reason blacks can't get ahead, but that partisan divide is even bigger than it has been in the past,"" said Jocelyn Kiley, an associate director at Pew Research Center. ""That's a point where we do see that partisan divides over issues of race have really increased in recent years."" What this could mean for electoral politics David Cohen, a political scientist at the University of Akron, said the finding that a majority of whites say whites are victims of discrimination fits right into one of the big narratives of the last presidential campaign. ""I think this does reinforce a lot of the resentment you saw in the 2016 election, especially among white, working-class voters lacking a college degree,"" said Cohen, who lives in northeastern Ohio, a traditionally Democratic stronghold full of white, working-class union members. Trump ran far better there, though, than Republicans typically do, as he easily won the battleground state of Ohio, 52 percent to 44 percent. But Cohen also adds that for all of the talk of Trump's message speaking directly to whites in the working class — white voters overall supported him in about the same numbers as they did for Mitt Romney four years earlier — 58 percent for Trump, 59 percent for Romney. And though it's possible that Trump's message to disaffected whites did make a difference in the decisive battleground states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, Cohen said the question remains: Did Trump create or significantly boost white resentment overall — or did he simply tap into a trend with deep roots and history? ""I'm not sure that he necessarily created this angst among white voters,"" Cohen said, ""but he certainly knew how to take advantage of it."" And it's something Trump — as president — has only continued to tap into. An earlier version of this story incorrectly said: ""More than half of whites — 55 percent — surveyed say they face discrimination on the job, in education and in a variety of other ways."" The poll question asked whether respondents believed discrimination against white people exists in the U.S. today generally speaking. The poll found that at most, 19 percent of whites say they have personally faced discrimination while applying for jobs.

npr,"October 29, 2017","After 'Choosing Donald Trump,' Is The Evangelical Church In Crisis?"," When Donald Trump announced he would be running for president, he didn't seem like the obvious candidate for evangelical voters, given his multiple divorces, use of crass language and one-time admission that he had never asked God for forgiveness.  Nonetheless, he did manage to coalesce 81 percent of white evangelical voters behind him in November. Almost a year since Election Day, President Trump's unlikely marriage with the religious right seems to have only strengthened, as seen at the Values Voter Summit earlier this month. Trump administration officials peppered the speaker list, and attendees praised the president as having been chosen by God to lead the country at this time.  God, Anger, Hope, and Why Christian Conservatives Supported Him by Stephen Mansfield Hardcover, 195 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? As author Stephen Mansfield details in his new book, Choosing Donald Trump: God, Anger, Hope, and Why Christian Conservatives Supported Him, Trump was able to tap into resentment within the parts of the evangelical community that boiled over during former President Barack Obama's tenure. They feared that religious freedom was under assault as a result of actions like the administration's birth control mandate and protections for LGBT people.  ""Fear, anger — both of those played a huge role,"" Mansfield told NPR. ""And Donald Trump definitely seemed to be the champion of those two dynamics, those two emotions."" According to Mansfield — who has written about the faith of former Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama — Trump spoke evangelicals' language on many issues. Trump promised to repeal the Johnson Amendment, which regulates political speech from the pulpit, and pledged to nominate a conservative Supreme Court justice to the bench, which he did in Neil Gorsuch. And many prominent faith leaders — including Liberty University's Jerry Falwell Jr. and First Baptist Dallas' Robert Jeffress — didn't just endorse Trump, they gave him their most full-throated blessing and defense.  But that fervent support from evangelicals may have come at a cost, Mansfield argues, as they overlooked actions that could be taken as antithetical to their faith, including comments about women and race. There have been growing racial and generational divisions within the church, Mansfield says, and Trump's election seems to have brought some of those simmering tensions to the surface, putting evangelicalism at a potential crossroads. Yet many evangelicals maintain fierce support. At the Values Voter Summit, for example, conservative commentator Bill Bennett noted: ""We are conscious of his history. We are conscious of his future. And as Oscar Wilde said, 'Just as every sinner has a future, every saint has a past.' "" Yet a younger, more diverse generation of evangelicals appears skeptical.  Mansfield recently talked to NPR about his book, Trump's history with religion, lessons learned from the 2016 election and what Trump's presidency has meant for evangelicals. The interview excerpts below have been edited for length and clarity.  Do you think that the number of evangelicals and evangelical leaders that have backed Trump has done harm to their witness? I think it has, yes. I think that they are especially going to lose influence amongst millennials, who are strongly social justice-oriented, and the surveys indicate that the vast majority of them are very suspicious of Donald Trump. You've got an unusual situation here where the leaders of the religious right are not only having to account to a watching world for why they compromised their religious message to support Donald Trump, but you also are going to have some blowback from the very people that the religious right is trying to reach. The very people these pastors are trying to reach — the young, people of color, etc. — I think they may have lost them and, in some cases, permanently. We saw a stark difference between how white and black evangelicals voted. How much do you think Trump's selection widened the racial chasm in the church and made racial reconciliation even even harder? I think it has exacerbated the problem tremendously. One of the points I make in the book is that a pastor or religious leader can endorse Donald Trump but not have to, as we say in our crass phrase, get in bed with him or become part of his PR team. But a lot of those public leaders were very outspoken for him. Never did we hear anyone say publicly, ""Sir, you're making racist statements, sir, when you say that a Mexican judge can't rule justly in a case involving you, you know, you've crossed the line."" Never did we hear those religious conservatives who supported him speak out about these race issues. We didn't see them marching in Ferguson; we didn't see them meeting with the leaders of Black Lives Matter.  So there they did exacerbate a racial chasm, whether they intended to or not. I think we're going to be paying for that for quite some time. Has this election exposed a generational divide among Christians? It has. In the end, the word that is used most often when I talk to the young is ""hypocrisy."" They sat in their churches, and they heard certain conduct described as wrong. Yet when Donald Trump did it, or when it was reported on a video, we heard kind of a ""boys will be boys"" sort of response even from very, very prominent religious leaders. They began to wonder if the message they had been hearing all those years in church was consistent with the people they had respected.  In the end the word that is used most often when I talk to the young is 'hypocrisy.' Author Stephen Mansfield  It's really thrown a lot of them into real turmoil, and I think as a result we're going to see the number of ""religious nones"" increase, because many of them will continue to be religious, continue to be believers in God. But they are losing confidence in the church they were once part of, and in some cases, that's a direct result of what happened in that election. You explore the Johnson Amendment and the history of it in the book and why Trump seized upon promising to abolish it.  Why do you think that was what was so effective? I think it was effective because it was almost like code language in a sense. I'm not really frankly sure that the average pastor, a religiously conservative pastor, thinks daily about the Johnson Amendment and can't wait until it's abolished. But I think those listening sessions that [televangelist] Paula White scripted for Donald Trump, Donald Trump did hear about the Johnson Amendment, it was something he could do. And so as he began talking about it, he realized that it echoed with a lot of religious conservatives and at least said, ""I'm concerned about your issues. I want to try to liberate your pulpit. I want to allow you to speak in spiritual terms about politics."" This was something that they had heard the opposite of from the Obama administration, and so it signaled more than it was really worth in political capital. You write a lot about the influence that Trump's pastor Norman Vincent Peale had on him and Peale's book, The Power of Positive Thinking, which was quite controversial at the time. Peale seems to have almost been a precursor to the prosperity gospel, which Trump seems to have aligned himself with the most, along with people like Paula White. Norman Vincent Peale himself said, ""I believe personally in the 'born again gospel,' but I talk about that in my church. Publicly, though, and in meetings around the country around the world, I talk more of a motivational kind of message."" And that's, I believe, the message that Donald Trump really drank from. I think that's the one that really shaped him. For example, not only ""the power of positive thinking"" was one of Norman Vincent Peale's phrases, but he also would go around saying, ""Attitude is more important than facts."" Well, if there's anything that we see with Donald Trump, it's that he believes that attitude, bravado. This is straight from Norman Vincent Peale. So I don't think he absorbed the message of transformation through Christ that Norman Vincent Peale believed but didn't proclaim very publicly. It seems like the conclusion that you draw in the book is that evangelical Christianity is in a state of crisis right now. Has that been exacerbated by Trump, and where can they go from there? Yeah, it has been exacerbated, and they are in crisis. And I think there's a lot of healing that that needs to happen. I mean, I know of large families that have met for Thanksgiving dinner and didn't meet this last Thanksgiving, and the dividing issue that brought strife was the Trump presidency. I know churches where there have been splits. I know of tension on church staffs. There's a great deal of turmoil, and evangelicalism as a whole is in flux, and a lot of it has to do with politics. I know many people who are saying, ""I'm not sure I'm staying in the church that I've been attending because it's become so political."" I have heard that phrase probably two dozen times.  So evangelicalism as an approach to Jesus and an approach to wanting to convert the world is fairly solid, but evangelicalism as a political movement is definitely in crisis. Author Stephen Mansfield So evangelicalism as an approach to Jesus and an approach to wanting to convert the world is fairly solid, but evangelicalism as a political movement is definitely in crisis. I think it's caused a lot of people to rethink what they're doing, what they're connected to, what kind of church they want to be in. And I think that's going to continue for quite a while. It's a tragedy. In fact, if you say the word evangelical to those outside of evangelicalism, they assume it's a political movement, and that's part of the problem. They don't know that it's more because that hasn't been the public face of evangelicalism. NPR thanks our sponsors Become an NPR sponsor ",http://www.npr.org/560097406
npr,"October 24, 2017","Why You Shouldn't Count On The Promised $4,000 'Raise' From GOP Tax Plan"," This week, Sarah Huckabee Sanders promoted one of the White House's chief selling points about the Republican tax plan. The pitch: American households will get an additional $4,000 as a result of the tax overhaul proposed in September. What would your family do w/ a $4,000 raise from the President’s tax cut plan? REPLY &amp; I’ll share your family’s story in the press briefing The number comes from an estimate produced by the Council of Economic Advisers earlier this month. And while it's impossible to do a flat-out true-or-false fact check on an estimate, this figure is likely to be repeated as the White House pushes tax overhaul, and there is reason to doubt that your household will get $4,000 — or even anything close to it. What the White House claims To be clear, this isn't the White House claiming that the average household would get a $4,000 tax cut as a result of the tax plan altogether. Indeed, depending on a variety of things that are still not laid out — how brackets are shifted around, which deductions will be eliminated, a change in the standard deduction — a new tax package could affect different people in wildly different ways. Rather, the White House is claiming that one part of the tax plan — the proposed corporate tax cut, from 35 to 20 percent — would trickle down to workers, as businesses bumped wages as a result of having smaller tax bills and also deciding to bring profits into the U.S. from overseas. The Council of Economic Advisers made this argument in a recent, controversial report posted on the White House website. In fact, that paper claims $4,000 is on the low end of its estimates. On the upper end, the average household could expect to get $9,000 back. The White House's method of getting to these numbers was simple — the CEA looked at estimates of how much corporate tax rates affect workers' wages, chose two estimates (one low and one high), and applied those to a 15-point corporate tax cut. Plugging in those numbers, along with average household income (around $83,000 in 2016), the White House found that the tax cut would boost that average household's income by around $4,000 to $9,000. But some economists say that math rests upon a shaky foundation. An economist fight ensues Already, with the word ""average,"" there's reason for a taxpayer to doubt that she would receive $4,000 from this change in tax policy. After all, extremes make averages — the CEA report, for example, estimated the median household could get $3,000. But the debate over this $4,000 figure goes much deeper than that. Well-regarded top economists — including some from the left (former President Barack Obama's Treasury Secretary Larry Summers and his CEA Chairman Jason Furman) and right (Harvard economist Greg Mankiw) soon piled on with their respective critiques and defenses of the CEA's report. One big sticking point in this debate is those figures that the CEA used in its math to get the $4,000 to $9,000 range. Economist Mihir Desai, whose work informed that math, tweeted that the CEA report ""misinterprets"" his results and therefore came up with estimates that are unrealistic. The CEA paper has also sparked fierce arguments over what share of the corporate tax burden workers bear. For one thing, the White House paper cited a variety of estimates for this, but it left out some that show labor's burden to be relatively small. For example, it cited a 2006 Congressional Budget Office report that said workers shoulder 70 percent of the corporate tax burden, but it did not cite a 2012 CBO report that said the figure was 25 percent. Another paper the CEA did not cite was a report from the Obama-era Treasury Department that said workers end up paying 18 percent of corporate taxes. As the Wall Street Journal's Richard Rubin reported in September, that paper recently disappeared from the Treasury website (however, another document saying that labor bears only 19 percent of the corporate tax burden still lives on the Treasury's site). And a September Congressional Research Service report criticized several of the papers that the CEA cites to support its conclusions (including Desai's). All of which is to say that there are many reasons for American taxpayers not to expect $4,000 from this tax overhaul package (and that's if it passes). Yes, it's reasonable to imagine that a big cut in corporate taxes could lead to some sort of bump in wages. But the economics of exactly how corporate tax rates affect workers simply isn't settled, to put it mildly. So is the White House's $4,000 figure plausible? ""No, it's not. It's way too high,"" said Joe Rosenberg, senior research associate at the Tax Policy Center, a D.C. tax policy think tank that has been critical of the Trump tax plan. Even some on the right believe the White House is overshooting with its estimate. ""This estimate is considerably higher than I would expect,"" wrote Michael Strain, director of economic policy studies at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute, for Bloomberg this week. ""We don't know the exact magnitude. Is it going to be $400 or $500, or is it going to be $4,000 to $9,000?"" is how Aparna Mathur, resident scholar in economic studies at AEI, put it. She has co-authored papers with CEA Chairman Kevin Hassett about the relationship between corporate taxes and wages. She adds, ""It does sound pretty high."" Mathur says the CEA's math was done correctly but that there is a problem in believing that math would work perfectly in the real world. ""The way I read it is, yeah, it takes an estimate from the literature, it applies the numbers directly and says it's likely you could get a $4,000 wage increase, but it has to be conditioned on everything else going so smoothly,"" she says. For its part, the White House defends its estimates. ""The analysis that produced this estimate follows the standards of the economics profession,"" a spokesperson wrote in an email. ""CEA remains happy to debate any methodological assumption, which some of the criticisms of the CEA study — including some that have been prominently covered in the media — have not done."" No policy happens in a vacuum One problem with the estimates, in Mathur's mind, is that a corporate tax cut wouldn't happen in a vacuum. Rather, it would come alongside other potential effects from the tax plan — a big deficit hike, for example. Congress just cleared the way for a new tax plan to add $1.5 trillion to the deficit. ""You're not going to allow fiscal deficits to continue indefinitely,"" she says. ""So then projecting these scenarios of $4,000, that starts sounding implausible."" Lawmakers might, for example, decide to raise taxes again in the future to try to close a fiscal hole. Or it's possible that a growing debt could eventually cause interest rates to rise, slowing the economy. Not only that, but it's not clear what else lawmakers might do to corporate taxes besides lowering the rates. They may also broaden the base, deciding to cut out businesses' deductions and credits to offset at least some of the lost revenue from a corporate tax rate cut. And that could mean offsetting some of the wage gains that might result from a corporate tax cut. Criticisms from the left, meanwhile, have taken aim not so much at the deficit-ballooning aspect of the tax plan as at the trickle-down economics behind it. Economist Stephanie Kelton, who advised the 2016 Bernie Sanders campaign, pointed out that ""sending a $4,000 check to every household in America raises average household incomes by $4,000."" Jacob Leibenluft, who worked for the Obama administration and currently is a senior adviser at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, likewise criticized the White House for trying to sell the benefits of a corporate tax cut to the middle class, instead of plotting out a middle-class tax cut. It's possible that that plan will cut the middle class's tax burden. In a recent estimate of the tax plan's effects, the Tax Policy Center found that it would help the middle class (but help higher earners far, far more). However, the tax plan as presented thus far has many holes in it — for example, it didn't specify what the income cutoff points would be for the new tax brackets. In addition, it left some promises of middle-class tax relief (""additional measures to meaningfully reduce the tax burden on the middle-class"") decidedly fuzzy. The assumptions that the Tax Policy Center made to fill in some of those holes led the administration to sharply rebuke the think tank. So when the administration came out with its own, assumption-based math, Rosenberg was surprised. ""It was strange to hear them to come out with such a specific estimate of what it would do to people's wages after saying it was completely implausible to think anybody could know anything about the effects of their plan,"" he says.

npr,"October 24, 2017","Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake, A Trump Critic, Will Not Seek Re-Election"," Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., announced in an impassioned speech on the Senate floor that he will not seek re-election in 2018, decrying the coarse tone of politics and ""flagrant disregard for truth or decency"" ushered in by the election of President Trump. His decision is the latest development in the ongoing GOP civil war. Flake gave the party's anti-establishment wing, which had been targeting him for defeat in next year's Republican primary, at least a temporary victory by retiring. But Flake has long made clear he cared more about speaking out against the president than any electoral consequences. And after he was fully unbridled with his decision on Tuesday, Flake seemed to hold nothing back in going after Trump and those who support him.  ""We must never regard as normal the regular and casual undermining of our democratic norms and ideals,"" Flake said in his address to the Senate chamber Tuesday. ""We must never meekly accept the daily sundering of our country — the personal attacks, the threats against principles, freedoms and institutions; the flagrant disregard for truth or decency; the reckless provocations, most often for the pettiest and most personal reasons, reasons having nothing whatsoever to do with the fortunes of the people that we have all been elected to serve. ""None of these appalling features of our current politics should ever be regarded as normal,"" Flake continued. ""This spell will eventually break. That is my belief,"" Flake added. ""We will return to ourselves once more. And I say, the sooner the better. Because we have a healthy government, we must also have healthy and functioning parties. We must respect each other again in an atmosphere of shared facts and shared values, comity and good faith."" Flake has been a frequent critic of Trump since the 2016 campaign and, as a target of right-wing frustration himself, had been seen as especially vulnerable to a GOP primary challenge in 2018. He was a top target of former Trump chief strategist Steve Bannon — who has vowed to purge the Republican Party of those lawmakers who don't fully support President Trump — for defeat in the GOP primary. Early public polls showed Flake trailing former Arizona state Sen. Kelli Ward, something mirrored in internal GOP numbers too.  While many national Republicans have concerns about Ward's ability to win a general election, Flake's exit now could actually help a stronger Republican candidate than Ward win the Aug. 2 primary. According to Senate GOP sources, possible candidates could include Reps. Martha McSally, David Schweikert and Andy Biggs, as well as state Attorney General Mark Brnovich.   From the outset, Flake had refused to bend to those forces, refusing to back the president in last year's election. The senator even penned a book earlier this year that was a damning rebuke of Trump's populist and nationalist agenda, accusing the GOP of making a ""Faustian bargain"" when the party overlooked Trump's abandonment of longtime conservative principles like free trade and didn't denounce many of Trump's controversial statements and stances. But Flake's speech on the Senate floor was an unprecedented indictment of a sitting president by a member of his own party. Flake said that he was speaking because ""there are times when we must risk our careers in favor of our principles"" but that his comments nonetheless came ""with no small measure of regret."" ""Regret, because of the state of our disunion, regret because of the disrepair and destructiveness of our politics, regret because of the indecency of our discourse, regret because of the coarseness of our leadership, regret for the compromise of our moral authority, and by our — all of our — complicity in this alarming and dangerous state of affairs. It is time for our complicity and our accommodation of the unacceptable to end,"" Flake implored his fellow Republicans. ""In this century, a new phrase has entered the language to describe the accommodation of a new and undesirable order — that phrase being 'the new normal.' But we must never adjust to the present coarseness of our national dialogue — with the tone set at the top,"" Flake continued, with a clear shot at Trump. Flake first informed the Arizona Republic of his decision, telling the newspaper ""there may not be a place for a Republican like me in the current Republican climate or the current Republican Party."" And he acknowledged that his decision was motivated, in part, because he was worried about the concessions he would have to make if he wanted to run a winning campaign. ""Here's the bottom line: The path that I would have to travel to get the Republican nomination is a path I'm not willing to take, and that I can't in good conscience take,"" Flake told the Republic. ""It would require me to believe in positions I don't hold on such issues as trade and immigration and it would require me to condone behavior that I cannot condone."" Flake's announcement came on the same day that Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., another retiring lawmaker, also unloaded on Trump amid their ongoing Twitter feud. Corker said that ""the constant nontruth-telling, just the name-calling, I think the debasement of our nation"" is what the president will be remembered by. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders defended Trump's tweets against Corker, saying that the president is a fighter and when he is hit, he's going to hit back. As for Flake — whom Trump has derided as ""toxic"" and ""weak"" on border security — Sanders said it was ""probably a good thing"" he wasn't seeking re-election given his lack of support in Arizona. Flake's seat is a target for Democrats hoping to pick up a seat in a year that looks very good for Republicans in the Senate, and Republicans believed that if he lost the primary, the seat would be much harder to hold. Now, his decision to retire throws the prospects for his seat even more up in the air. Senate Democrats heralded Flake's decision as ""another example of the divisiveness roiling Republican primaries."" ""These dynamics will continue to hinder Republican efforts in Arizona and whatever candidate succeeds in claiming their nomination will fall short of [Rep.] Kyrsten Sinema and her proven record of results for Arizona's working families,"" Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee spokesman David Bergstein said in a statement. Republicans, meanwhile, expressed optimism that the seat would stay in GOP hands.  ""Jeff Flake is as decent and thoughtful of a man that's ever been in the U.S. Senate, and no one can question his willingness to put country over party,"" National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., said in a statement. ""His enduring legacy will be his success of eliminating earmarks and fighting corruption to protect taxpayers, and standing for the conservative principles of individual liberty and economic freedom."" Other GOP leaders also were saddened that Flake decided to head for the exits. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said in a statement that ""Jeff's retirement is a loss to the Senate and the greater cause of conservatism."" And speaking just after Flake on the Senate floor, Arizona's senior Sen. John McCain said, ""I have seen Jeff Flake stand up for what he believes in knowing full well that there would be a political price to pay."" Those opposing Flake took his decision as a clear victory. A Bannon ally told CNN's Kaitlan Collins that Trump's former campaign CEO had added ""another scalp to his collection as another establishment domino falls."" Bannon's Breitbart News, where he returned as chairman after leaving the White House in August, was clearly celebrating too. WINNINGWINNINGWINNINGWINNINGWINNINGWINNINGWINNINGWINNINGWINNINGWINNINGWINNINGWINNINGWINNINGWINNINGWINN https://t.co/XOT6IO0K3r And Ward, who is being backed by Bannon, said in a statement that ""Arizona voters are the big winner in Jeff Flake's decision to not seek re-election. They deserve a strong conservative in the U.S. Senate who supports President Trump and the 'America First' agenda."" NPR thanks our sponsors Become an NPR sponsor ",http://www.npr.org/559865339
npr,"October 24, 2017",Transcript: Sen. Jeff Flake Announces He Won't Seek Re-Election," It must also be said that I rise today with no small measure of regret. Regret because of the state of our disunion. Regret because of the disrepair and destructiveness of our politics. Regret because of the indecency of our discourse. Regret because of the coarseness of our leadership. Regret for the compromise of our moral authority. And by ""our"" I mean all of ""our."" Complicity in this alarming and dangerous state of affairs. It is time for our complicity and our accommodation of the unacceptable to end.

But we must never adjust to the present coarseness of our national dialogue with the tone set at the top. We must never regard as normal the regular and casual undermining of our democratic norms and ideals. We must never meekly accept the daily sundering of our country. The personal attacks. The threats against principles, freedoms and institution. The flagrant disregard for truth and decency. The reckless provocations, most often for the pettiest and most personal reasons — reasons having nothing whatsoever to do with the fortunes of the people that we have been elected to serve. None of these appalling features of our current politics should ever be regarded as normal. We must never allow ourselves to lapse into thinking that that is just the way things are now. If we simply become inured to this condition, thinking that it is just politics as usual, then heaven help us.  Without fear of the consequences and without consideration of the rules of what is politically safe or palatable, we must stop pretending that the degradation of our politics and the conduct of some in our executive branch are normal. They are not normal.  Reckless, outrageous and undignified behavior has become excused and countenanced as ""telling it like it is,"" when it is actually just reckless, outrageous and undignified. And when such behavior emanates from the top of our government, it is something else. It is dangerous to a democracy. Such behavior does not project strength because our strength comes from our values. It instead projects the corruption of the spirit and weakness. It is often said that children are watching. Well, they are. And what are we going to do about that? When the next generation asks us, ""Why didn't you do something? Why didn't you speak up?"" What are we going to say? Mr. President, I rise today to say, ""Enough.""  We must dedicate ourselves to making sure that the anomalous never becomes the normal. With respect and humility, I must say that we have fooled ourselves for long enough that a pivot to governing is right around the corner, a return to civility and stability right behind it. We know better than that. By now, we all know better than that.  Here today, I stand to say that we would be better served, we would better serve the country by better fulfilling our obligations under the Constitution by adhering to our Article 1 ""old normal."" Mr. Madison's doctrine of separation of powers. This genius innovation which affirms Madison's status as a true visionary and for which Madison argued in Federalist 51 held that the equal branches of our government would balance and counteract with each other if necessary. ""Ambition counteracts ambition,"" he wrote. But what happens if ambition fails to counteract ambition? What happens if stability fails to assert itself in the face of chaos and instability? If decency fails to call out indecency? Were the shoe on the other foot, would we Republicans meekly accept such behavior on display from dominant Democrats? Of course we wouldn't. And we would be wrong if we did.  When we remain silent and fail to act when we know that silence and inaction is the wrong thing to do — because of political considerations, because we might make enemies, because we might alienate the base, because we might provoke a primary challenge, because ad infinitum, ad nauseam — when we succumb to those considerations in spite of what should be greater considerations and imperatives in defense of our institutions and our liberty, we dishonor our principles and forsake our obligations. Those things are far more important than politics.  Now I'm aware that more politically savvy people than I will caution against such talk. I'm aware that there is a segment of my party that believes that anything short of complete and unquestioning loyalty to a president who belongs to my party is unacceptable and suspect. If I have been critical, it is not because I relish criticizing the behavior of the president of the United States. If I have been critical it is because I believe it is my obligation to do so.  And as a matter and duty of conscience, the notion that one should stay silent and that as the norms and values that keep America strong are undermined and as the alliances and agreements that ensure the stability of the entire world are routinely threatened by the level of thought that goes into 140 characters — the notion that we should say or do nothing in the face of such mercurial behavior is ahistoric, and I believe, profoundly misguided.  A president, a Republican president named Roosevelt, had this to say about the president and a citizen's relationship to the office: ""The president is merely the most important among a large number of public servants. He should be supported or opposed exactly to the degree which is warranted by his good conduct or bad conduct. His efficiency or inefficiency in rendering loyal, able and disinterested service to the nation as a whole."" He continued: ""Therefore, it is absolutely necessary that there should be a full liberty to tell the truth about his acts. And this means that it is exactly as necessary to blame him when he does wrong as to praise him when he does right. Any other attitude in an American citizen is both base and servile."" President Roosevelt continued: ""To announce that there must be no criticism of the president or that we are to stand by a president right or wrong, is not only unpatriotic and servile, but is morally treasonable to the American public.""  Acting on conscience and principle is the manner in which we express our moral selves, and as such loyalty to conscience and principle should supersede loyalty to any man or party. We can all be forgiven for failing in that measure from time to time. I certainly put myself at the top of the list of those who fall short in this regard.  I am holier than none but too often we rush not to salvage principle but to forgive and excuse our failures so that we might accommodate them and go right on failing until the accommodation itself becomes our principle. In that way, and over time, we can justify almost any behavior and sacrifice any principle. I'm afraid that this is where we now find ourselves. When a leader correctly identifies real hurt and insecurity in our country, and instead of addressing it, goes to look for someone to blame, there is perhaps nothing more devastating to a pluralistic society. Leadership knows that most often a good place to start in assigning blame is to look somewhat closer to home. Leadership knows where the buck stops. Humility helps. Character counts. Leadership does not knowingly encourage or feed ugly or debased appetites in us. Leadership lives by the American creed: ""E Pluribus Unum."" ""From many one."" American leadership looks to the world and just as Lincoln did sees the family of man. Humanity is not a zero sum game. When we have been at our most prosperous, we have been at our most principled. And when we do well, the rest of the world does well. These articles of civic faith have been critical to the American identity for as long as we have been alive. They are our birthright and our obligation. We must guard them jealously and pass them on for as long as the calendar has days. To betray them or to be unserious in their defense is a betrayal of the fundamental obligations of American leadership and to behave as if they don't matter is simply not who we are.  Now, the efficacy of American leadership around the globe has come into question. When the United States emerged from World War II, we contributed about half of the world's economic activity. It would have been easy to secure our dominance, keeping those countries who had been defeated or greatly weakened during the war, in their place. We didn't do that. It would have been easy to focus inward. We resisted those impulses. Instead, we financed reconstruction of shattered countries and created international organizations and institutions that have helped provide security and foster prosperity around the world for more than 70 years.  Now it seems that we — the architects of this visionary, rules-based world order that has brought so much freedom and prosperity — are the ones most eager to abandon it. The implications of this abandonment are profound, and the beneficiaries of this rather radical departure in the American approach to the world are the ideological enemies of our values. Despotism loves a vacuum. And our allies are now looking elsewhere for leadership. Why are they doing this? None of this is normal. And what do we, as United States senators, have to say about it? The principles that underlie our politics, the values of our founding, are too vital to our identity and to our survival to allow them to be compromised by the requirements of politics. Because politics can make us silent when we should speak, and silence can equal complicity. I have children and grandchildren to answer to. And so, Mr. President, I will not be complicit or silent.  I've decided that I would be better able to represent the people of Arizona and to better serve my country and my conscience by freeing myself from the political considerations that consume far too much bandwidth and would cause me to compromise far too many principles. To that end, I am announcing today that my service in the Senate will conclude at the end of my term in early January 2019.  It is clear at this moment that a traditional conservative who believes in limited government and free markets, who is devoted to free trade, who is pro-immigration, has a narrower and narrower path to nomination in the Republican Party, the party that has so long defined itself by its belief in those things. It is also clear to me, for the moment, that we have given in or given up on the core principles in favor of a more viscerally satisfying anger and resentment. To be clear, the anger and resentment that the people feel at the royal mess that we've created are justified. But anger and resentment are not a governing philosophy. There is an undeniable potency to a populist appeal. [But] mischaracterizing or misunderstanding our problems and giving in to the impulse to scapegoat and belittle threatens to turn us into a fearful, backward-looking people. In the case of the Republican Party, those things also threaten to turn us into a fearful, backward-looking minority party.  We were not made great as a country by indulging in or even exalting our worst impulses, turning against ourselves, glorifying in the things that divide us, and calling fake things true and true things fake. And we did not become the beacon of freedom in the darkest corners of the world by flouting our institutions and failing to understand just how hard won and vulnerable they are. This spell will eventually break. That is my belief. We will return to ourselves once more. And I say, the sooner the better. Because we have a healthy government, we must also have healthy and functioning parties. We must respect each other again in an atmosphere of shared facts and shared values, comity and good faith.  We must argue our positions fervently and never be afraid to compromise. We must assume the best of our fellow man and always look for the good. Until that day comes, we must be unafraid to stand up and speak out as if our country depends on it. Because it does. I plan to spend the remaining 14 months of my Senate term doing just that. Mr. President, the graveyard is full of indispensable men and women. None of us here is indispensable. Nor were even the great figures of history who toiled at these very desks, in this very chamber to shape the country that we have inherited. What is indispensable are the values that they consecrated in Philadelphia and in this place — values which have endured, and will endure, for so long as men and women wish to remain free.  What is indispensable is what we do here in defense of those values. A political career does not mean much if we are complicit in undermining these values. I thank my colleagues for indulging me here today.  I will close by borrowing the words of President Lincoln, who knew more about healthy enmity and preserving our founding values than any other American who has ever lived. His words from his first inaugural were a prayer in his time and are now no less in ours: ""We are not enemies but friends. We must not be enemies. Though passion may have strained, it must not break the bonds of our affection. The mystic chords of memory will swell when again touched, as surely as they will be, by the better angels of our nature."" Thank you Mr. President. I yield the floor.

""The last couple of years, we’ve seen concerns around the budget time at the budget hearings raised about the funding formula and access to funding,"" Graham says. Graham presented four funding formula options at a county commission workshop last week. The proposals range from keeping it the same to using a formula based on demographics in a city or based on senior center membership numbers. ""Our mission as an organization is to help seniors and individuals with disabilities remain in the community as long as possible,"" Graham says. The county spent about $640,000 on senior centers in the past two years. The 2018 budget provides about $10,000 less in funding. The senior centers are just one of 15 programs in the county’s Division on Aging. The current funding formula allots nearly half of the Division on Aging’s $1.3 million budget to the senior centers. -- Follow Deborah Shaar on Twitter @deborahshaar    To contact KMUW News or to send in a news tip, reach us at news@kmuw.org.    Sedgwick County commissioners approved additional funding for a program that provides in-home services for older people who have limited physical abilities.

I was fortunate enough to sort of follow where my grandpa was living in his later years because while I was at school in San Marcos, Texas he was living in Leander, Texas, which is only about an hour and a half drive away. So I was able to spend good quality time before his sicknesses really started taking over. Then he began getting really sick and they moved to Hereford and coincidently, I was moving back to Hereford, as well, because I was about to have a baby and wanted to be near family. As long as I knew my grandpa, I can say that I have never met a person who impacted all of the people around him like he did. Not only that, but the way that he cared and loved my grandma was something that I could really look up to. Hearing his story about coming from a single parent family to where he would end up and his journey along the way was inspiring and I also think that it was a good way to remember him and his life.

But a dark cloud is hanging over Houston's Friday night victory after first baseman Yuli Gurriel made a racist gesture toward Japanese LA Dodgers player Yu Darvish, pulling at the corners of his eyes and appearing to say ""Chinito,"" which is translated as ""little Chinese boy."" Just a few hours before Saturday night's game, Rob Manfred, the commissioner of Major League Baseball, announced that Gurriel would be suspended without pay for the first five games of the 2018 season. He will also be required to undergo sensitivity training during the off-season, and the Astros will donate his lost wages to ""charities supporting diversity efforts."" pic.twitter.com/2e2JJLg821 ""There is no place in our game for the behavior — or any behavior like the behavior we witnessed last night,"" Manfred said in a press conference. ""There is no excuse or explanation that makes that type of behavior acceptable."" And yet, the suspension beginning next season means Gurriel is back in the Astros' lineup tonight. Darvish released a statement on Twitter, encouraging his fans to stay positive. ""No one is perfect,"" Darvish wrote. ""That includes both you and I. What he had done today isn't right, but I believe we should put our effort into learning rather than to accuse him. If we can take something for this, this is a giant step for mankind. Since we are living in such a wonderful world, let's stay positive and move forward instead of focusing on anger. I'm counting on everyone's big love."" The Astros have never won a World Series, and Brien Straw of Houston Public Media told NPR's Michel Martin, baseball has been an important morale booster in the wake of Hurricane Harvey. ""The World Series without question has provided the relief this city has needed,"" Straw says. ""That there's this diversion, and it's honestly such a thrilling diversion that a team is in the World Series — is something that's really nice.""

npr,"October 28, 2017",SALT Reduction Becomes Major Sticking Point In Tax Overhaul. So What Is SALT?," Updated 4:30 p.m. ET, Oct. 29  For some Republicans, the tax overhaul would taste better with SALT. The House GOP narrowly passed a budget resolution this week, taking an important first step on the path to overhauling the tax code. But 11 GOP lawmakers voted against the measure out of concern the tax bill would eliminate the deduction for state and local taxes, or SALT. That tax break is especially popular — and valuable — in high-tax states such as New York, New Jersey and California. The SALT deduction is one of the few that the Trump administration has singled out for the chopping block. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told NBC's Meet The Press he wants to get ""the federal government out of the business of subsidizing the states."" According to the Tax Foundation, more than half the total savings from the deduction goes to taxpayers in just six states: California, New York, New Jersey, Illinois, Texas and Pennsylvania. Among those, only Texas is reliably Republican — and Trump won Pennsylvania in the 2016 presidential election. There is no shortage of GOP House members from those states who are sure to get an earful from constituents defending the tax break. Some of those lawmakers will fight to avoid the no-SALT diet. And, as this week's 216-212 vote on the budget resolution shows, Republicans have little margin for error. Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, chairman of the powerful Ways and Means Committee, had acknowledged the concerns from pro-SALT lawmakers and said they'll have to be addressed somehow. ""They made it clear,"" Brady told reporters. ""They need this problem solved before they vote 'yes' on tax reform."" Now, there's a compromise among Republicans. Brady says the deduction for local property taxes will remain in the House GOP bill, but the deductions for income and sales taxes are still expected to be cut. People with higher incomes tend to rely on deductions for income tax, while those with lower incomes tend to value the property tax deduction more. Though, the lion's share of SALT deductions benefit those with higher incomes.   Bloomberg first reported the decision and added that Rep. Chris Collins, R-N.Y., who was raising major concerns about scrapping the SALT deduction, welcomed the move predicted it would be enough to resolve concerns from other Republicans.  Democrats have also defended the SALT deduction. Democratic House leader Nancy Pelosi tweeted earlier this month that half of households that claim the SALT deduction make less than $100,000 a year. This is striking: 50% of households that claim State &amp; Local Tax deduction make under $100K – &amp; now @SpeakerRyan wants to throw it away. While it's true that many middle-class households claim the SALT deduction, it's the wealthy who get the lion's share of the savings. According to the Tax Foundation, nearly 90 percent of the value of the deduction goes to families making more than $100,000. Lawmakers, along with the administration, have promised to eliminate various tax breaks to help offset the revenue the government stands to lose by cutting individual and corporate tax rates. But the administration has vowed to preserve some of the biggest breaks, including the deductions for mortgage interest and charitable giving. Doing away with the SALT deduction is projected to save the government between $1.3 trillion and $1.8 trillion over the next decade. If lawmakers decide to preserve the tax break, they might have to find that revenue elsewhere. Brady has suggested limiting the tax break for retirement savings, although the president pushed back hard against that idea. The Ways and Means Committee chairman plans to release a draft text of the tax bill next week. GOP leaders hope to hold a House vote on the plan before Thanksgiving, with or without SALT.

The plane touched down safely and on schedule around 1 a.m. local time, albeit not totally intact, following the Thunder's 116-119 loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves on Friday night in Minneapolis.

Small forward Josh Huestis tweeted, ""I guess we hit something?"" Delta spokeswoman Elizabeth Wolf told NPR that although crews are still investigating, the ""something"" was likely a bird, a common culprit in midair collisions. She added the plane ""sustained damage to its nose cone while on descent into Chicago."" Airplanes have been having unwelcome encounters with wildlife ever since man sent its own winged craft into the sky. Orville Wright's plane hit a bird over an Ohio cornfield in 1905, an incident he wrote about in his diary. The Bird Strike Committee USA, a data-tracking organization that serves the airline industry, says more than 20,000 wildlife strikes are reported each year in the U.S. alone. The vast majority involve birds, although bats and reptiles and mammals that have wandered onto runways have also been involved. Usually wildlife collisions are not fatal, although they have killed some 250 people worldwide since 1988, says the group. The Federal Aviation Administration says most collisions occur during the fall when young birds leave the nest and the cold drives migration toward warmer climates. The FAA says damage to planes from the strikes could be as high as nearly a billion dollars a year. I guess we hit something? 30,000 feet up... pic.twitter.com/Rem9GmwRKq Airports — where most of the collisions occur — can reduce the risk, the FAA says, by implementing wildlife management programs, such as by removing plants hospitable to wildlife. Around a century after the Wright flight, the perhaps best-known bird collision led to the ""Miracle on the Hudson."" On Jan. 15, 2009, US Airways Flight 1549 collided with a flock of Canada geese after taking off from New York's LaGuardia Airport, resulting in two disabled engines. Captain Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger guided the plane onto the icy waters around New York City, leading to the safe disembarkment of all 155 people onboard. On Saturday, a spokesperson for the Thunder told The Oklahoman that all players, staff and coaches were just fine upon their arrival in Chicago.

npr,"October 28, 2017","5 Years After Sandy, New York Rebuilds With The Next Flood In Mind"," The Domino Sugar construction site on the Brooklyn waterfront is about as close to the water as you can get.  ""When you came here in 2012, you could almost reach down and touch the East River, and now you're considerably above it,"" said David Lombino, a managing director at development firm Two Trees, standing on a concrete pier that juts out 50 feet over the water.    The developer bought this waterfront site for $185 million in 2012 after falling in love with the expansive views of the Manhattan skyline and the Williamsburg Bridge.  A month later, the storm surge from Sandy flooded most of the property.  Lombino says the company spent the next two years totally reworking its plans. It raised the grade of the entire site between 2 and 7 feet and moved the footprint of new buildings back at least 50 feet farther from the river.  That was expensive. But Lombino says it was worth it to reduce the risk of future flood damage.  ""It's not a matter of if it will flood again,"" Lombino said. ""It's a matter of when and how quickly we can bounce back the next time."" It's not just developers who are planning for the next storm. Since Sandy, New York City has made big changes to its building and zoning codes for structures of all kinds — from luxury apartments to single-family homes — aimed at getting expensive heating and electrical systems out of basements and off the ground.  ""We're replacing less-safe buildings with more-safe buildings,"" said Daniel Zarrilli, New York's senior director of climate policy and programs. ""So that means we're elevating the house. We're elevating the core infrastructure — the mechanicals, the electrical equipment, the meter. All of that is being raised out of harm's way and out of the flood plain."" Even the city's critics concede New York has moved quickly since Sandy.   
                Klaus Jacob, a research scientist at Columbia University, says that while New York City has done a lot to prepare for the next flood, a long-term vision is still needed.

 Klaus Jacob, a research scientist at Columbia University, says that while New York City has done a lot to prepare for the next flood, a long-term vision is still needed. ""The city has done a lot of things that really help for the current situation,"" said Klaus Jacob, a research scientist at Columbia University. ""What I think is missing: that we have a long-term vision."" Jacob thinks these new resilient building practices are great. But he worries they won't be enough if sea levels rise 6 feet by the end of the century, as some models suggest.  ""Those buildings themselves may be OK because they are actually constructed in such a way that they can flood,"" Jacob said. ""But people may not be able to get in and out of those buildings because the streets are flooded."" Jacob thinks the city should be talking now about the idea of ""managed retreat"" — steering new development away from the water and turning some low-lying areas into park or even marshland.  In Staten Island, residents of a few coastal neighborhoods have taken voluntary buyouts and left. In most parts of the city, though, homeowners are rebuilding in neighborhoods that flooded. And high-end real estate developers in Brooklyn and Manhattan are still building right up to the water's edge. But some are changing what might have done five years ago.

""It's about just building more or less the same building as you always do,"" said Simon Koster, a principal with JDS Development Group, ""but just placing things a little bit differently or being a little bit more thoughtful about what those materials are."" Koster says his company incorporated some key lessons from Sandy into the American Copper Buildings, a pair of new luxury apartment towers that sit just a few hundred feet from the East River in Manhattan.  Before Sandy, a room on 48th floor of the west tower might have been a penthouse apartment. Instead, it's occupied by five large backup generators that can supply emergency power to 760 apartments.  ""You would have enough power to charge your phone,"" Koster said. ""You'd be able to keep food in your refrigerator, at a bare minimum. You would be able to flush your toilet and you would have an elevator that goes up to the floor you live on."" Koster's company is betting those will become selling points for future tenants as sea levels rise. But even the best flood-proofing won't help if the buildings turn out to become luxury islands every time there is a big storm or an usually high tide.

The Astros relied on early scoring and a gutsy relief effort by right-hander Brad Peacock who came in for starter Lance McCullers with one out in the sixth inning and held the Dodgers without a hit for 3 2/3 innings. He struck out four and surrendered a walk. McCullers went 5 1/3 innings, giving up three runs and four hits for the win. With their victory tonight, the Astros are 7-0 in their home park in this postseason. Houston got on the score board first by opening the bottom of the second inning with a solo home run by first baseman Yuli Gurriel, followed by a double by right fielder Josh Reddick. Designated hitter Evan Gattis walked. A hard-hit single by left fielder Marwin Gonzalez scored Reddick. Catcher Brian McCann followed with another single, scoring Gattis and making the score 3-0. The Astros added a fourth run when third baseman Alex Bregman hit a sacrifice fly to center, scoring Gonzalez.

 Houston Astros' Yuli Gurriel celebrates his second-inning home run in Game 3 of the World Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers on Friday. Dodgers starter Yu Darvish was pulled for reliever Kenta Maeda after Astros second baseman Jose Altuve smoked a double to center field. Maeda managed to get the final out without further damage. The Dodgers threatened to come back immediately in the top of the third after their first three batters earned walks. But they scored only one run when shortstop Corey Seager grounded into a double play. The Astros added their fifth run in the bottom of the fifth inning after a single by Reddick, his second hit of the night. Gattis reached first base on an infield bouncer to Dodgers pitcher Tony Watson, whose wild throw to first allowed Reddick to score. In their half of the sixth inning, the Dodgers scratched back by scoring two runs. Seager walked, followed by a double by third baseman Justin Turner. Seager scored on right fielder Yasiel Puig's ground out. Turner scored from third base on Peacock's wild pitch, making the score 5-3. The Astros threatened to blow the game wide open in the bottom of the seventh inning. Gurriel lead off with a double to left field. An out later, Gattis was intentionally walked. Houston loaded the bases when McCann hit an infield single.  But Dodger reliever Ross Stripling retired center fielder George Springer on a deep drive to center that left Houston fans holding their heads in dismay. However, by the eighth inning, Peacock looked confident as he retired the last six Dodger batters in a row.

npr,"October 26, 2017",Most Of The New JFK Files Have Been Seen Before In Some Form," Lee Harvey Oswald is shown on Nov. 22, 1963, after being arrested for the murder of President John F. Kennedy. Updated Oct. 27, 9:50 p.m. ET  The 2,891 records relating to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy released by the National Archives Thursday contain many interesting tidbits. The thing is, many if not all of the documents dropped Thursday have, in fact, already been made public. The National Archives says that of the 2,891 records released on Thursday, only 53 are being made available for the first time in any form. The others had been ""released previously in redacted form."" Jefferson Morley, who edits the JFK Facts blog, calls it a small slice of what might have been released. ""President Trump really withheld most of the records yesterday. He released about 2,800 records,"" Morley said, ""There's probably 25,000 records that remain secret."" Philip Shenon, a former New York Times correspondent and author of A Cruel and Shocking Act: The Secret History of the Kennedy Assassination, said he ""didn't see any bombshells"" in the files, saying they were ""mostly documents that we've seen before."" Still, they make for some interesting reading. And they are useful, Shenon said, as a reminder of what he calls ""a rush to judgment by the federal government"" to identify Oswald as ""this pure lone wolf who never could have been stopped"" — when, in fact, the CIA and FBI each knew about Oswald and ""may have known much more about the threat he posed than they ever wanted to admit."" Alas, it seems that many of the documents that would shed light on that were held back under orders from President Trump, who bowed to the wishes of the two agencies to keep secret hundreds of other documents, on grounds they contain ""certain information that would harm national security, law enforcement or foreign affairs."" Morley, author of The Ghost: The Secret Life of CIA Spymaster James Jesus Angleton, is interested in viewing files of CIA officers who he says were both opposed to Kennedy's policies, especially in Cuba, and who also were involved in assassination operations of foreign leaders. ""Those people would be of interest to anybody who wanted to know what was going on and were they possibly involved in foul play,"" Morley said. And he pointed to a document that was released, at least in part. It was the interview of former CIA Director Richard Helms by David Belin, a Warren Commission member who later led the Rockefeller Commission which was investigating the CIA in the mid-1970s. Belin asked Helms if Oswald was a CIA agent. ""That's the end of the document, we never get the answer,"" Morley said. ""The fact that we didn't even get the answer to the question is just very emblematic of how limited the full disclosure was yesterday."" President Trump tweeted Friday night that he has approved release of the documents that were not made public Thursday at the request of the CIA, FBI and perhaps other agencies. #JFKFiles pic.twitter.com/AnPBSJFh3J   ""JFK Files are being carefully released,"" Trump tweeted Friday morning. ""In the end there will be great transparency. It is my hope to get just about everything to public!"" The FBI was warned that Oswald might be in danger of being killed himself just before he was shot by Dallas nightclub owner Jack Ruby. In one document written on Nov. 24, 1963, just after Ruby shot and killed Oswald, Hoover dictates in a memo that the FBI field office in Dallas had received a phone call from a man ""saying he was a member of a committee organized to kill Oswald."" The FBI notified the Dallas Police Department, which ""assured us adequate protection would be given. However, this was not done,"" Hoover said. The memo also notes Ruby denies he made the phone call to the FBI. Hoover goes on to call Oswald's killing ""inexcusable"" given the warnings the agency gave to Dallas police about the threats it had received, and the FBI director also surmises that the president's shooter being shot so soon after his arrest would only sow doubt that Oswald was the real killer. In the nearly 54 years since Kennedy was assassinated, that is exactly what has happened — with questions continuing to arise about Oswald's motives; possible ties to communist forces in Cuba and Russia; and why Ruby, who had ties to the mob, would murder Oswald. And that's exactly why the release of the latest government documents is of so much interest to so many. As NPR reported previously: ""The files are among the last to be released by the National Archives under a 1992 law that ordered the government to make public all remaining documents pertaining to the assassination. There has long been a trove of conspiracy theories surrounding Kennedy's death in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963, including doubts about whether assassin Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone, as the Warren Commission determined in its report the following year. ""Other files are being withheld owing to what the White House says are national security, law enforcement and foreign policy concerns. The vast majority of what's being withheld is at the request of the FBI and the CIA."" Hoover also wrote that the FBI held out hope that Oswald would confess before he died, but that did not happen. ""We had an agent at the hospital in the hope that he might make some kind of a confession before he died, but he did not do so,"" Hoover said. Among the other interesting findings: there was concern inside the Communist Party in the Soviet Union that the assassination was part of a right-wing coup, and a National Security Council memo discusses various possible operations to sabotage the Castro regime in Cuba, though it's not known if any were put into place.

npr,"October 29, 2017",Are Social Media Sites Doing Enough To Combat Rumors And False News?," As fire fighters in California's wine country worked frantically to contain and put out devastating wildfires that killed at least 42 people in recent weeks, and while his officers were still evacuating residents and searching through the burned ruins of homes for missing persons, Sonoma County Sheriff Rob Giordano had another problem to address. ""I want to talk about something, there's a little rumor control issue,"" Giordano said during a news briefing updating the media and area residents on fire fighting efforts, evacuation orders and other urgent matters. Giordano explained that a couple of days earlier, his officers had arrested a homeless man for starting a small fire to keep warm in a local park where he was known to sleep. ""There's a story out there that he's the arsonist for these fires,"" Giordano said. ""That is not the case. There's no indication he is related to these fires at all."" The erroneous story came from Breitbart News, the right-wing website run by President Trump's former political strategist Steve Bannon. It reported that an undocumented immigrant had been: ""arrested for suspicion of arson in Wine Country fires that have killed at least 40 residents."" That, Sheriff Giordano said, simply was not true. ""I just want to kill that speculation right now so we didn't have things running too far out of control."" After this story was shot down by the sheriff and was debunked by Politifact Factcheck.org, and Snopes, Breitbart eventually added a clarification. But the damage had been done — the original story had spun out of control. One version was shared nearly 60,000 times on Facebook and a follow-up piece with the same false narrative was shared 75,000 times. That does not include the number of times the story was tweeted out or shared through other social media platforms, nor does it include how often it was picked up and pushed out by other right wing sites, including Drudge Report and InfoWars. This is an example of how false information is being spread through the big social media platforms and it raises questions about whether companies such as Facebook and Twitter are doing enough to stop it. Because even as the wild fires still raged, the false stories ignited a squabble between the Sonoma County Sheriff and Trump Administration, as the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement criticized the Sheriff's office as a ""non-cooperative jurisdiction"" that ""left their community vulnerable to dangerous individuals."" Giordano again had to set the record straight, calling the ICE director's comment ""misleading, inaccurate, and inflammatory."" This is not the only instance in recent weeks that law enforcement authorities have had to spend time and resources during a crisis trying to stop rumors and misinformation. In Houston after Hurricane Harvey, phony news photographs proliferated on social media supposedly showing the airport underwater and sharks swimming through flooded streets. Authorities also had to quell false rumors that levees had burst and that a dam had failed.

""It is resource intensive"" at a time law enforcement budgets are tight, Hutchens says, but she adds it is a good thing for law enforcement to develop a strong social media presence of their own, to provide urgent information on developing situations and quell misinformation that could put residents in danger. She acknowledges, though, that some people continue to believe a false narrative even after hearing the facts. ""You know, the political tempo is so high right now, I think that then people are just not listening to what the truth is,"" Hutchens says. To some degree, this is what the creators and disseminators of false content intend. They use automated systems to search for and push out misleading articles and misinformation reinforcing certain points of view, and then place them into people's social media feeds who read and share similar items. ""So if we see something and it agrees with our assumptions, we are more likely to believe it and share it,"" says Indiana University journalism professor Elaine Monaghan. Monaghan says social media users need to become smarter consumers of news and look into the source and validity of information. ""There's no question that when there's false information in a moment of crisis and danger, of course humans may respond in a way that puts them in even more danger,"" Monaghan says. ""And that's where we really have a problem we need to confront. "" But she also says all the responsibility does not fall just on the social media user. Facebook, Twitter and other social media platforms themselves need to do a better job policing misinformation. ""So much news is being carried there, that it is incumbent on these organizations that are making money on news, to act responsibly in the dissemination of it,"" Monaghan says. It is likely that some members of Congress will ask that of Google, Facebook and Twitter, when executives from those tech companies appear at hearings on Capitol Hill this week.

npr,"October 28, 2017",The Evil Within 2 Puts Gamers Right In The Middle Of A Scary Story," As connoisseurs of the genre know, good horror stories come in many forms: scary movies, scary books, scary TV shows — even scary comic books. In recent years, I've come to appreciate the scary video game, which provides an immersive style of storytelling that's hard to experience anywhere else. Well-designed horror games put you right behind the eyes of the protagonist, with spooky and lethal dilemmas all around. That flitting shadow in the corner of the room? You can turn, and look, and investigate. That ominous creaking up the stairs? You can check that out, too. Should you grab that kitchen knife? (Yes. Always grab that kitchen knife.) The Evil Within 2, released just in time for Halloween, is a good example of how the video game format can deliver a horror story experience unmatched in other media. Sequel to the critically acclaimed 2014 original, the game doesn't just tell a scary story; it puts you right in the middle of it. The setup Players assume the role of former police detective Sebastian Castellanos, whose traumatic experiences in the first game have driven him to slow suicide, death-by-alcohol style. Knowledge of the previous game isn't required, but it helps explain why Castellanos agrees to plug his brain into an experimental machine that generates parallel nightmare realities. (Watch a trailer for the game here, complete with an unexpected, ultra-creepy rendition of an old Duran Duran song. Note that the trailer includes a content warning.) The premise of The Evil Within is familiar — virtual worlds come cheap in the digital age — and the tough-guy dialogue is standard-issue B-movie nonsense. But that's all easily forgiven once you experience the twisted imagination of series creator Shinji Mikami, author of the venerable Resident Evil games that arguably established the entire genre of survival horror. The game's virtual world represents a kind of collective unconscious that puts poor detective Castellanos into the perpetually colliding nightmares of several people and entities, including a serial killer with an old-school photography fetish. Director Mikami has created an ultimate playground for himself and his team of designers, a world where physics are optional and reality itself is subject to interpretation. The game's main story mode provides about 15 to 20 hours of sustained fright as Mikami's team empties its digital sketchbooks into the story's twisted virtual world. Creature design is outstanding – The Evil Within series has the best monsters this side of a Guillermo del Toro movie. The game also provides a series of deeply unnerving environments that you're free to explore on your own. The new open-world areas are a departure from the first game's more linear storytelling.

 The sequel to the 2014 original, The Evil Within 2 provides new open-world areas to explore. Open, wander, peer As a storytelling medium, books and films are usually better than video games when it comes to subtle themes and deep characterization. (Case in point, this year's best horror movie, Get Out, blends horror with piercing social satire.) But video games do excel at visual and environmental design. With The Evil Within 2, the game makers and art designers conjure unique variations on those archetypal images and scenarios that tend to frighten us as a species. Blood. Darkness. Creepy little dolls. That's where the technology comes in handy. Thanks to powerful 3-D image processing systems, today's top-shelf console and PC games generate extremely realistic objects and environments. Those rapidly accelerating technical specs deliver what amounts to an expanded cinematic experience, where the ""screen"" is all around you at all times. If you choose to, you can open that door, or wander down that alley, or peer into that mirror. Some details on the new game for veteran or returning players. The survival horror elements remain – limited resources, puzzle solving – but the game adds some RPG (role-playing game) aspects including skill progression and expanded crafting options. The combat system is adequate and most encounters provide options for stealthy solutions rather than frontal assault. Note: You can always run away. In fact, you should usually run away.  For fans of the horror genre who have never dabbled in games. The Evil Within 2 is a nice entry-point option (and by nice I mean utterly terrifying). It's not the best horror story ever told via video game, but it's state-of-the-art for the genre and features some concepts and images you've likely never seen before. And don't worry about gamer proficiency. Adjustable difficulty levels basically let you turn the game into an interactive storytelling experience. Choose carefully, and you'll find that The Evil Within 2 achieves the ultimate goal of any horror story: scaring the bejeezus out of you.

npr,"October 26, 2017",Twitter Says It Will Ban Ads From Russian News Agencies After Interference In 2016 Election," Twitter has announced that from now on, it will reject all advertising from the Russian news outlets Sputnik and Russia Today, or RT. It will also give away the nearly $2 million it earned from past advertising. Both Sputnik and RT are backed directly by the Kremlin, and U.S. intelligence officials say both were used by the Russian government to help throw the U.S. presidential election into chaos. NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik joins us now with more on Twitter's move. David, it's long been known that these two news outlets answer to Moscow. Why is Twitter doing this now? DAVID FOLKENFLIK, BYLINE: Well, you know, the U.S. intelligence officials came to the conclusion the Russians were trying to disrupt things basically a year ago. It announced earlier this year that they had concluded that the effort was there to really help put a thumb on the scales for President Trump or for now President Trump. And then, you know, not so many weeks ago, U.S. officials decided to try to make RT and Sputnik register as foreign agents - that is, as entities explicitly trying to do the will of the Russian government in the sense that a lobbyist might or, you know, a - I mean, an agent, somebody acting on the government's behalf, not simply as a news organization owned by the government. This has put a lot of pressure on organizations that do business with RT and Sputnik to figure out how to respond. SIEGEL: Well, is Twitter now saying that it agrees with U.S. intelligence agencies that the Russian news outlets tried to tip the election to Trump? FOLKENFLIK: Twitter's official statements have actually been relatively restrained, just sort of acknowledging the effort to disrupt and that the ability of RT to take advantage of the viral nature of social media platforms, particularly Twitter in this instance, are things that they have to take into account. SIEGEL: And what are the Russian news outlets - say about this? FOLKENFLIK: Well, they're saying a few things. They're accusing Twitter of hypocrisy. They're pointing out that Twitter officials came to them with a rather extensive plan to step up their advertising on the site and that, you know, that Twitter had courted their business. In addition, Russian officials at the Foreign Ministry are saying that this violates all kinds of United States and international protections on freedom of expression, that these are journalistic outlets. And you know, there is the point being made, I think with validity, that the ads really accomplished less in many cases than some of the content and the news coverage, the framing of things, the misinformation, disinformation and actual stories that got picked up without - for amplification without any subsidy, without any advertising at all. SIEGEL: Now, the Russians of course aren't the only ones getting a tough look from Capitol Hill. Three committees are questioning tech giants next week, Twitter among them. You think that had something to do with Twitter's announcement today? FOLKENFLIK: Oh, I think that's not incidental at all. I think there's a great desire on Capitol Hill to understand how this disruption worked. You know, some more than others want to take action to ensure, to press these companies, to take actions to ensure that this kind of disruption doesn't happen. There's some pressure for greater transparency, and of course Twitter and Facebook and Google have always wanted to protect their secret sauce and their algorithms. And in some corners, there's a desire to try to pressure these social media outlets in such a way that if they don't take greater responsibility, that they could be regulated. And I think that's the greatest fear of all for these social media platform. So you're seeing them start to take actions and to take conciliatory measures to at least publicly signal their discomfort, which - what occurred on their platforms in the hope of staving off greater government action. SIEGEL: That's NPR's David Folkenflik on the news that Twitter has announced that it will reject all advertising from the Russian news outlets Sputnik and Russia Today. David, thanks.

npr,"October 26, 2017","AI Model Fundamentally Cracks CAPTCHAs, Scientists Say"," Scientists say they have developed a computer model that fundamentally breaks through a key test used to tell a human from a bot. You've probably passed this test hundreds of times. Text-based CAPTCHAs, a rough acronym for Completely Automated Public Turing Test To Tell Computers and Humans Apart, are groups of jumbled characters along with squiggly lines and other background noise.  You might be asked to type in these characters before signing up for a newsletter, for example, or purchasing concert tickets.  There are a staggering number of ways that letters can be rendered and jumbled together where it is usually intuitive for a human to read, but difficult for a computer. The ability to crack CAPTCHAs has become a key benchmark for artificial intelligence researchers.

 Captcha code on a laptop. Many have tried and seen some success – for example, a decade ago, Ticketmaster sued a tech company because it was able to bypass the CAPTCHA system and purchase concert tickets on a massive scale. But those previous attempts simply exploited weaknesses in a particular kind of CAPTCHA, which could be easily defended against with slight changes in the program, says Dileep George, the co-founder of the AI company Vicarious. A new model, described in research published today in Science, fundamentally breaks the CAPTCHA's defenses by parsing the text more effectively than previous models with less training, George says.  He says that previous models trying to get machines to learn like humans have largely relied on a prevailing AI technique called deep learning. ""Deep learning is a technique where you have layers of neurons and you train those neurons to respond in a way that you decide,"" he says. For example, you could train a machine to recognize the letters A and B by showing it hundreds of thousands of example images of each. Even then, it would have difficulty recognizing an A overlapping with a B unless it had been explicitly trained with that image.  ""It replicates only some aspects of how human brains work,"" George says. We are, of course, able to learn from examples. But a human child would not need to see a huge number of each character to recognize it again. For example, George says, a brain would recognize an A even if it were larger or slanted. George's team used a different approach, called a Recursive Cortical Network, that he says it is better able to reason about what it is seeing even with less training.  ""We found that there are assumptions the brain makes about the visual world that the [deep learning] neural networks are not making,"" George says. Here's how their new approach works: ""During the training phase, it builds internal models of the letters that it is exposed to. So if you expose it to As and Bs and different characters, it will build its own internal model of what those characters are supposed to look like. So it would say, these are the contours of the letter, this is the interior of the letter, this is the background, etc. And then, when a new image comes in ... it tries to explain that new image, trying to explain all the pixels of that new image in terms of the characters it has seen before. So it will say, this portion of the A is missing because it is behind this B."" There are multiple kinds of CAPTCHAs. According to the paper, the model ""was able to solve reCAPTCHAs at an accuracy rate of 66.6% ..., BotDetect at 64.4%, Yahoo at 57.4% and PayPal at 57.1%."" The point of this research, though, actually has nothing to do with CAPTCHAs. It's about making robots that can visually reason like humans. ""The long-term goal is to build intelligence that works like the human brain,"" George says. ""CAPTCHAs were just a natural test for us, because it is a test where you are checking whether your system can work like the brain."" ""Robots need to understand the world around them and be able to reason with objects and manipulate objects,"" George adds. ""So those are cases where requiring less training examples and being able to deal with the world in a very flexible way and being able to reason on the fly is very important, and those are the areas that we're applying it to."" What does he say to people who are uneasy about robots with human-like capabilities? Simply: ""This is going to be the march of technology. We will have to take it for granted that computers will be able to work like the human brain."" It's not clear how big an impact this research will have on information security. George points out that Google has already moved away from text-based CAPTCHAs, using more advanced tests. As AI gets smarter, so too will the tests required to prove that a user is human.

npr,"October 26, 2017","Twitter Bans Ads From Russian State Media, Citing Election Interference Efforts"," Updated at 2:10 p.m. ET A pair of Russian state media organizations will no longer be able to advertise on Twitter, the company said Thursday — a direct result of their role in Russian interference in the 2016 election. The announcement took place less than a week before much-anticipated hearings on Capitol Hill at which representatives from Facebook, Twitter and Google are expected to be grilled by lawmakers about how Russia used their platforms as part of its influence campaign in the U.S. Twitter's decision to suspend advertising by Russia Today, or RT, and the news agency Sputnik is ""effective immediately,"" the company announced in a statement. ""Early this year, the U.S. intelligence community named RT and Sputnik as implementing state-sponsored Russian efforts to interfere with and disrupt the 2016 presidential election, which is not something we want on Twitter,"" the company said. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence referred to RT and Sputnik specifically in a report in January as organizations that ""contributed to the influence campaign by serving as a platform for Kremlin messaging to Russian and international audiences."" Twitter pointed to that report in announcing the decision, as did California Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, in praising it. ""Twitter's decision should prevent these entities from pushing Russian propaganda in front of users who may not realize the manner in which Russia employs both RT and Sputnik to spread disinformation and undermine democracies around the world,"" Schiff said in a statement. The Russian government, as well as RT, responded immediately. Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told state media that the move was a violation of international laws that ""guarantee the freedom of speech."" She added that ""retaliatory measures will naturally follow,"" a message echoed by RT's editor-in-chief, Margarita Simonyan. ""I never thought that Twitter is under the control of the U.S. security services — it seemed like a conspiracy theory. But now Twitter appears to have admitted it,"" Simonyan said to another state media agency. ""This is highly regrettable. It is particularly regrettable that now U.S. media operating in Russia will feel the tender response of the Russian authorities."" RT has also been involved in a back-and-forth with the Justice Department, over whether it should register its American arm under the Foreign Agents Registration Act.  Doing so would require the company to disclose funding information and be more outwardly transparent about its relationship with the Russian government, but as CNN reports, despite a mid-October deadline request by the DOJ, there is no sign RT is planning on registering. RT and Sputnik will be allowed to remain regular users of Twitter — in other words, to post with normal accounts — but they won't be allowed to pay to promote them. Twitter added in its statement that the company would be donating the $1.9 million it is projected to have received from RT since 2011, to fund external research into the impact of Twitter on elections, with a focus on ""malicious"" automated bots. The company also vowed this week that it would launch an ""industry-leading"" transparency site about who buys ads on its service and what messages are involved.

npr,"October 25, 2017",Tesla Turns Power Back On At Children's Hospital In Puerto Rico," Tesla has used its solar panels and batteries to restore reliable electricity at San Juan's Hospital del Niño (Children's Hospital), in what company founder Elon Musk calls ""the first of many solar+battery Tesla projects going live in Puerto Rico."" The project came about after Puerto Rico was hit by two devastating and powerful hurricanes in September, and Musk reached out about Tesla helping. Musk's company announced its success in getting the hospital's power working again less than three weeks after Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello tweeted on Oct. 6, ""Great initial conversation with @elonmusk tonight. Teams are now talking; exploring opportunities."" Tesla's image of the project's solar array, in a parking lot next to the hospital, has been liked more than 84,000 times since it was posted to Instagram Tuesday. Hospital del Niño is first of many solar+storage projects going live. Grateful to support the recovery of Puerto Rico with @ricardorossello pic.twitter.com/JfAu11UBYg Earlier this month, Musk tweeted that some of his company's work is being rerouted so it could ""increase battery production for Puerto Rico &amp; other affected areas."" The hospital's new system allows it to generate all the energy it needs, according to El Nuevo Dia. The facility has 35 permanent residents with chronic conditions; it also offers services to some 3,000 young patients, the newspaper says. As for who is paying for the power system, the head of the hospital tells Nuevo Dia that for now, it's a donation — and that after the energy crisis is over, a deal could make it permanent. Both Rossello and the tech company tweeted about the project this week, with Tesla saying in a post, ""Grateful to support the recovery of Puerto Rico with @ricardorossello"" — and Rossello stating, ""A major contribution of @Tesla to the Hospital del Niño."" Una gran aportación de @Tesla para el Hospital del Niño. pic.twitter.com/fwbO5Jlo23 The news of restoring permanent power at the hospital comes as millions of people in Puerto Rico continue to rely on generators for electricity. As of Wednesday morning, the Electric Power Authority reported that its power service was at 25 percent. The task of rebuilding Puerto Rico's power grid is expected to take months and to cost as much as $5 billion. Last week, the territory's electric and power authority signed a $300 million contract with Whitefish, a small and relatively young Montana company, to restore the power grid. The deal has sparked scrutiny and skepticism, as NPR's Laurel Wamsley and Nicky Ouellet of Montana Public Radio reported. Tesla isn't the only tech company trying to help Puerto Rico; Google's parent company, Alphabet, has deployed balloons from its Project Loon to the territory, to help parts of the island reconnect after much of its phone system went down.

npr,"October 25, 2017","Amazon's Newest Service Would Let Couriers Unlock Front Doors, Monitored By Cameras"," For years, Amazon has been testing the limits of online deliveries — expanding the number of things you can order at the click of a button (sometimes literally), pushing shipments to arrive faster, toying with delivery by drones. Now the company is pushing at a new boundary — the front door. Amazon Key, a new service announced Wednesday, would allow couriers to open the doors of customers who opt in, in order to leave packages inside a house or apartment. The service is only available to Amazon Prime members. It requires a smart lock, which can be unlocked remotely, as well as the Amazon Cloud Cam — a new Amazon security camera, also announced on Wednesday. Amazon Key promises to turn on the camera (pointed at your door) every time the door is unlocked and show you a video of the full delivery. ""Each time a delivery driver requests access to a customer's home, Amazon verifies that the correct driver is at the right address, at the intended time, through an encrypted authentication process,"" Amazon says in a statement. ""Once this process is successfully completed, Amazon Cloud Cam starts recording and the door is then unlocked. No access codes or keys are ever provided to delivery drivers."" The service will also allow you to unlock the door for friends or family. Eventually, Amazon says, it will have options for service providers (like cleaning services or dog sitters) to enter as well. A kit to start using the service, including a Cloud Cam and smart lock, begins at $249 and requires Amazon Prime membership ($99 annually). It's only available in certain cities (where Amazon handles deliveries directly). Amazon Key addresses issues of security and convenience, while raising its own questions about security and privacy. Using the service would prevent package theft and obviate the need to stay home or arrange for a spare key for a contractor or visitor. But it requires customers to be comfortable with a smart lock controlled by Amazon and with an Amazon-connected camera monitoring the inside of their home and communicating to the cloud. Even if users are willing to trust Amazon with that level of access to their homes, they might have other concerns; Internet-connected smart devices can be vulnerable to hacking. Meanwhile, the unlocking of the front door might not be the key component of this new service. The Verge points out that Amazon is on a ""quest to manage your home life and integrate itself into your daily routine."" The Amazon Cloud Cam is a direct challenge to smart-home cameras offered by Google's Nest, as well as Logitech and a host of other companies. Offering a novel delivery service exclusively for customers who buy the camera might give Amazon an edge over the competition and put the camera in more homes. Adding a camera that monitors front doors and is integrated with Alexa and the front lock ""would be positioning Amazon to know a lot more about [people's] lives and habits, like when they leave the house in the morning, how often they go on vacation, and when they get back from work at night,"" the Verge writes.

npr,"October 25, 2017",Apps Have More People Tuning In To Police Chatter When Disaster Strikes," Alert I received on my police scanner app while vegas shooting was in progress. Multiple shooters and arrests. I listened to the broadcast pic.twitter.com/ww8bFjuUol When Floyd Conrade heard gunshots just above his Las Vegas hotel room the night of Oct. 1, one of his first reactions was to turn on a police scanner app on his phone. He wanted to know what was happening. ""The whole feeling of not knowing what was going on was keeping me at bay, I guess. I have a scanner app on my phone. I tuned it in and listened to scanner activity,"" Conrade told The New York Times. ""I couldn't tell exactly what was going on. I did hear on the scanner that an officer was shot."" Many others were doing the same that night during the massacre that killed 58 people and injured hundreds of others. About 75,000 people were tuning in to Las Vegas police radio communications on Broadcastify, an online platform for scanner radio communication streams, according to the company's CEO, Lindsay Blanton. ""Police scanner"" was featured among the most searched-for phrases on Apple's App Store, even days after the shooting. For years, hobbyists, journalists and others have been tuning in to public safety radio in the U.S., where most channels are open to all ears, using actual scanners. But in recent years, with the increased popularity of online streaming and scanner apps, police radio chatter has become more accessible to the public. Why do people listen? Those open frequencies — unorganized and sometimes uncomfortable to hear — are drawing attention in the wake of the high-profile shooting and the multiple natural disasters in the past few months. Susan Lindberg of Utah, a former Bay Area resident, was following the Northern California wildfires closely from the beginning by tuning in to local fire departments' frequencies on her app. ""They evacuated Calistoga today, one of our fav places. We've been in tears on and off all day,"" she tweeted. ""Firefighters are amazing."" Diana Penn of Texas says she has returned to listening to police radio in light of recent events. For her, the most important reason for tuning in usually involves loved ones. ""I ... have a teen boy who drives, and an elderly mother who is going blind and shouldn't be driving,"" she says, so she monitors a scanner app for auto accidents. 
                Public safety radio channels in several Northern California counties topped the list of top feeds on Broadcastify.com on Oct. 12 amid the region's massive wildfires.

 Public safety radio channels in several Northern California counties topped the list of top feeds on Broadcastify.com on Oct. 12 amid the region's massive wildfires. ""Whenever a major incident happens in the country regarding public safety — either police, fire, EMS — we'll see a significant uptick of folks that will go to Broadcastify to listen in real time to what's going on,"" says Blanton. There is no general demographic information that shows who listens to the apps, but Allen Wong, the developer of 5-0 Radio, one of dozens of scanner apps available, says some of the heaviest users of his app are news reporters, retired police officers and relatives of police officers and firefighters. They also include concerned citizens worried about their neighborhoods, people stuck in natural disaster areas and hospital staffs preparing emergency rooms immediately after major incidents, he says. Certainly notable that after the Vegas tragedy, police scanner &amp; meditation apps are trending in Apple's App Store pic.twitter.com/eblWQ5ICKN ""People like the app for different reasons,"" Wong says. ""Some want to listen to it out of curiosity. Some listen to it for reassurance that things are under control. Some listen to it for the thrill of it, like watching a reality show live."" In some cases, people use the apps to try to help police. Penn, a disabled veteran, says she heard about an elderly man with dementia wandering toward her neighborhood. ""I brought my phone [with] scanner app on, and went for a walk to see if I could find him."" She says she was unable to locate the man but the police later did. But public interference in police activities is discouraged. Some agencies argue that information gleaned from scanner feeds can sometimes complicate their operations. One obvious concern is the potential for suspects listening in while they're being sought by authorities. During the manhunt of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing suspects, Broadcastify temporarily took its feeds of area law enforcement offline to protect authorities' efforts. Some police departments may decide to encrypt their radio transmissions during investigations or special circumstances, but agencies generally aren't rushing to do it, Broadcastify's Blanton told NPR last year. ""Agencies understand that what we do is legal, and there's not much pushback,"" he added. Yu-Ning Aileen Chuang is the Business Desk intern.

npr,"October 25, 2017","Honolulu's 'Distracted Walking' Law Takes Effect, Targeting Phone Users"," Police in Honolulu on Wednesday will begin writing tickets for people who get distracted by their cellphones while walking in a crosswalk. Honolulu is the first major city in the country to pass such a law, citing a high rate of pedestrians being hit in crosswalks. ""Starting today, texting while walking in a crosswalk can get you a ticket,"" Hawaii Public Radio's Bill Dorman reports for our Newscast unit. ""In fact, a downward glance at a screen of any kind will cost you — a phone, a tablet, a video game."" Under the new law, the only legal reason for a pedestrian to use a cellphone while crossing a street or highway would be to call 911 to report an emergency. Minimum fines for breaking the new law start at $15; for repeat offenders, the penalty ranges from $75 to $99. Higher rates — up to $100 for a first offense, $200 for a second, and $500 for a third — had been considered earlier this year. Mayor Kirk Caldwell signed Bill 6, also known as the Distracted Walking Law, in July. At the time, he said that Honolulu held ""the unfortunate distinction of being a major city with more pedestrians being hit in crosswalks, particularly our seniors, than almost any other city in the county,"" as NPR's Miles Parks reported. According to HPD, more than 10,000 citations were issued last year for mobile electronic device violations.  As the law took effect, the city of Honolulu cited a National Safety Council warning that when pedestrians use a cellphone, ""this distraction can cause them to trip, cross roads unsafely or walk into motionless objects such as street signs, doors or walls."" After thousands of distracted walking injuries were reported, the NSC says, it added a new category to track the trend in its annual statistical report, Injury Facts. In the 90 days since the bill was signed, Honolulu police have been working to remind people of the risks of using an electronic device while walking across a street — risks that, as of Wednesday, also include a fine.

npr,"October 25, 2017","Under Congressional Microscope, Twitter Vows New 'Transparency' On Ads"," The San Francisco-based microblogging service said Tuesday that it plans to unveil an ""industry-leading transparency center"" through which it will ""offer everyone visibility into who is advertising on Twitter, details behind those ads"" and tools through which users can respond. ""We are committed to stricter policies and transparency around issues-based ads,"" wrote Bruce Falck, Twitter's general manager for revenue product and engineering. Twitter and its larger peers, Facebook and Google, are under scrutiny from Capitol Hill over the role they played in Russia's influence campaign targeting the 2016 presidential election. Together, the three platforms command a global reach and touch billions of users, and members of Congress want to try to prevent them from being exploited in the same way again. Russian influence-mongers used a combination of clandestine spy techniques — including cyberattacks and snooping — and overt public relations tools, including online ads and human agents — to interfere in the presidential race. In the case of Twitter specifically, the company has acknowledged selling just under $275,000 worth of ads to Russia's state-backed RT news agency. It also was and is used to amplify controversy, both by automated bots that promote both sides of divisive issues and by human agents who stir the pot as trolls. Twitter has vowed to quash as much of that as it can by refining the technical workings of its service, but company leaders also have acknowledged there are limits to what they'll prevent or police. That's one reason why Falck's post focused on advertising, over which Twitter has stronger control. He said the company will disclose all ads running on the service, the amounts of money spent, the identities of buyers and details about whom the ads target. Another reason is that Twitter, Facebook and Google are trying to mollify members of Congress who've proposed legislation that would require similar commitments about disclosures and other changes to the way they do business. Twitter said it looks ""forward to engaging with members of Congress and other key stakeholders on these issues as the legislative process continues,"" but the companies and other technology advocates have said that a new law might not be necessary. Big Tech wants to regulate itself without new obligations or restrictions from D.C. Virginia Sen. Mark Warner — the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee and one of the sponsors of legislation that would mandate disclosure — welcomed Twitter's announcement. ""A good first step,"" Warner said in a tweet circulated by his office, ""particularly public disclosure of ads info. Online political ads need more transparency &amp; disclosure."" Warner and his co-sponsors, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., announced their legislation last week. On Tuesday, Warner's office also circulated the text of an editorial in Bloomberg View, which said the bill was ""entirely necessary.""

npr,"October 25, 2017","Amid GMO Strife, Food Industry Vies For Public Trust In CRISPR Technology"," Scientists have used a popular gene editing tool called CRISPR to snip out a tiny piece of DNA from one particular gene in a white button mushroom. The resulting mushroom doesn't brown when cut. There's a genetic technology that scientists are eager to apply to food, touting its possibilities for things like mushrooms that don't brown and pigs that are resistant to deadly diseases. And food industry groups, still reeling from widespread protests against genetically engineered corn and soybeans (aka GMOs) that have made it difficult to get genetically engineered food to grocery store shelves, are looking to influence public opinion. The technology is called Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats, or CRISPR. It's a technique that Alison Van Eenennaam, an animal genetics professor at University of California, Davis, says can de-activate a gene. Or, as she puts it: ""It's editing. It's like going into a Word document and basically replacing one letter, maybe that instead of 'wind,' you want it to say 'wine,' "" she says. Skeptics, like Dana Perls with the environmental group Friends of the Earth, say food companies are trying to distance themselves from terms like GMO and genetic engineering that have caused them trouble with consumers. ""These new gene editing technologies like CRISPR are genetic engineering. And if this is genetic engineering, then call it that,"" says Perls. She says these producers are just trying to pull the wool over consumers' eyes with a strong public relations push. Dozens of crops and livestock developed with CRISPR technology are years from the market, though the U.S. Department of Agriculture already said it won't regulate CRISPR-developed products like other genetically engineered food, since no foreign genetic material is introduced in the process. The Food and Drug Administration will decide which new products are safe. To get ahead of any criticism, a group of heavyweights in the food industry have joined forces to form the Coalition for Responsible Gene Editing in Agriculture, which is funded by members like the U.S. Pork Board, Monsanto, Syngenta and Bayer. The board's CEO, Bill Even, says the food industry missed a chance to do this when the earlier wave of genetically engineered food made it to the market. ""There was never any conversation with consumers around what is this and what did it mean,"" he says. ""Fast forward now today, there's a lot of debate around GMOs and food. The public rightly [is] ... interested in knowing what's in their food."" People don't often trust big companies, says Charlie Arnot, who leads the coalition and is the CEO of the Center for Food Integrity. But when it comes to CRISPR, there are three key strategies Arnot says will help get consumers on board. First: CRISPR is not a secret. ""Those in technology have to be more transparent and be much more engaged in a public conversation and dialogue, in order to answer those questions, address the skepticism and ultimately result in earning consumer trust in what they're doing in gene editing,"" he says. Second, the coalition wants to show that it shares the same values that shoppers do. So, its members are sponsoring and attending events like CRISPRcon to engage in public discussions about the technology and its potential animal welfare, societal and environmental benefits. ""If people trust you, science doesn't matter. If people don't trust you, science doesn't matter,"" Arnot says. ""It only matters after you cross that trust threshold. So you really have to engage in that values-based dialogue to build trust, and then you're given the permission to introduce the science."" And that's the third strategy: These companies want consumers to know that CRISPR isn't like other forms of genetic engineering. CRISPR changes the way genes are expressed; it doesn't necessarily add genetic material from another species, although it can be used that way. ""That's going to be the path that will ultimately lead to greater trust,"" Arnot says. ""If we shortcut that path, we run the risk of potentially having this significantly beneficial technology not be accepted."" But persuading consumers to buy into CRISPR will be an uphill battle for Arnot and other industry groups. Food and environmental advocacy groups already are asking questions about CRISPR, as well as raising concerns over tracing genetically edited food in the system and the potential lack of regulatory oversight. This story comes to us from Harvest Public Media, a reporting collaboration that focuses on agriculture and food production. Kristofor Husted is based at member station KBIA in Columbia, Mo. The audio of this story, as did a previous Web version, states that CRISPR doesn't add genetic material from another species. However, it can be used that way.

npr,"October 24, 2017","SecureDrop, Encrypted System For News Tips, Announces Fix For 'Vulnerability'"," During a very short window of time, as a SecureDrop server was being set up, a sophisticated attacker with advance knowledge of the installation could hypothetically have attacked the server. Sources' identities would still be concealed, but the attacker could have gained access to all the material sent between sources and journalists. Cybersecurity experts say that while it's impossible to definitively prove that no attack occurred, the odds are extremely low. If it did happen, says Matthew Green, a cryptographer at Johns Hopkins University, ""it seems like there's a good chance you would see some evidence."" But after examining installation logs from multiple organizations, ""we have no evidence that this happened, or indeed anyone knows about the bug,"" says Jennifer Helsby, the lead developer of the SecureDrop platform. SecureDrop is an open-source tool used by many news organizations, including NPR, as a way for sources to provide documents and information without revealing their identity. Versions of the tool date back to 2013 and are designed to enable whistleblowers to work with investigative reporters. Many organizations, including NPR, have now reinstalled SecureDrop with the newly released fix. Helsby suggests that worried sources who want to use SecureDrop could encrypt data before they upload it and use a tool provided in the security-oriented Tails operating system to strip metadata from documents. ""Like all software, there's always the chance of vulnerabilities,"" she says. Nicholas Weaver, a computer scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, notes that a determined attacker could always send a person to physically compromise a server. And Green says that while the SecureDrop system is designed to provide some protection even if the server is compromised, ""there's no way to build a perfectly secure system for this purpose."" Sources should take additional steps to protect themselves, like never sending original documents and avoiding scanners, which can add revealing watermarks, he says.

npr,"October 29, 2017",Did The EPA Censor Its Scientists?," Last week, the Environmental Protection Agency abruptly pulled a group of its scientists from speaking at a scientific meeting set to take place Monday. The conference was focused on exploring ways to protect the Narragansett Bay Estuary in Rhode Island. Climate change happens to be one of the threats to the estuary and the EPA's researchers were set to talk on this issue. Given the administration's hostility to climate science, the new leaders of the EPA were quickly accused of censoring their own scientists. ""They don't believe in climate change,"" John King, a professor of oceanography at the University of Rhode Island, told New York Magazine, ""so I think what they're trying to do is stifle discussions of the impacts of climate change."" The charges of scientific censorship that have been leveled at the EPA are indeed troubling. The EPA's only defense of their actions was that ""it's not an EPA conference."" Given these events, it's worth remembering that there is a long, sad history of governments trying to muzzle, stifle or censor the fruits of scientific research. It's a history Americans might want to pay attention to, given how poorly those muzzling efforts worked out for the nations that tried to implement them. The most famous example of forcing a scientist to stop talking was Galileo and the Catholic Church. In the early 1600s, the Church wanted the astronomer and physicist Galileo to stop publicly arguing that the Earth revolved around the sun. The Church's official position was that the sun orbited Earth and the Earth was fixed in space, the center of all things. Though Galileo was warned about his actions, he continued to argue for the ""heliocentric"" solar system his research supported. Eventually, in 1633, he was brought to trial, forced to recant his views and was placed under house arrest for the rest of his life. It is said that as Galileo was led away, he muttered in Italian ""even so, it does move."" Yes, the Earth moves. It does, in fact, orbit the sun — and no amount of politically motivated censorship could change that fact. More than 300 years later, the Church admitted its error. A more modern and potent example of a nation shooting itself in the foot by censoring science comes via Soviet Russia. It was almost 100 years ago that agronomist Trofim Lysenko became a power in Russian science. Lysenko believed plants and animals could be ""taught"" new characteristics that would be inherited by the next generation. Ignoring everything biologists understood about evolution, Lysenko promised this methods would skyrocket farm production to new levels and feed a starving Russia. He made his ideas align with the political ideology of the day — Stalinism — and rose high enough in power to control Russian agricultural science. Lysenko censored and persecuted scientific opponents even though his ideas were a disaster for crops yields. It was not until the latter 1950s and early 1960s that ""Lysenkoism"" was finally rejected as the non-science that it was. Along with the vast scale of human losses, in the end it was Russia's long-term viability as a scientific power that Lysenkoism hurt most. By censoring any idea that did not meet with government approval, the revolution that was DNA and genetics passed Russia by. Russian biology never really recovered. Censoring science for political expediency is folly of the highest order. First, a nation cannot maintain its position as a leader in science and technology if it censors science and technology that doesn't match ideology. Ideology can't bind science for very long. But censoring science that doesn't match ideology sends a very clear message to the rest of the world about how that nation values science. Why does that matter? Science runs on talent. For young talented people who want to develop the next round of life-saving drugs or the next billion-dollar technology, the message censorship sends is quite clear: Go somewhere else, somewhere that takes research seriously; go do your work there. But in the end, the greatest folly in government scientific censorship is failing to recognize that you will be caught. But it's not your political opponents that will catch you. Instead, it's the world itself that will trip you up. It will come in the next ""never-seen-before"" hurricane, or the next dangerous epidemic. Nature, which is the point of scientific inquiry, will always have the last word. The censorship those in power impose does nothing but blind those powers to the consequences of ignoring nature. That's because nature is, was, and always will, be the higher power. You would think we'd have learned that by now.

TARAJI P. HENSON: (As Katherine Johnson) Orthogonalization algorithm? Yes, sir. I prefer it over Euclidean coordinates. BLOCK: ""Hidden Figures"" ended up being screened at more than 100 U.S. embassies around the world, says State Department official Stacy White. STACY WHITE: It so caught the imagination of people that we at the State Department have been doing additional programming and exchanges based on that. BLOCK: Exchanges like a program they're calling Hidden No More, which brought 48 women in science and technology fields to the U.S. from countries all over the world. They include an aerospace engineer, a director of a coding school, an executive at a robotics institute and our next guest, Persis Mbangsi. She's a chemical engineer who works at ALUCAM, an aluminum plant in Cameroon. We reached her in California. That's the last stop on her U.S. tour. BLOCK: Ms. Mbangsi, welcome to the program. PERSIS MBANGSI: Thank you so much for having me. BLOCK: How unusual is it for you as a woman to have the kind of job that you have in Cameroon? MBANGSI: It is very, very unusual because ALUCAM is as almost 63 years now. And I'm the first female leader. And in my country, you have a little of barriers like cultural barriers. You have funding barriers. You have language barriers because it's a bilingual country. We speak both English and French. So you have all these challenges in front of you. And I say I'm blessed and privileged because I actually could conquer most of those barriers. In the field, even in the plants, you need to see me on a typical day (laughter). BLOCK: Yeah? MBANGSI: I'm fully dressed with my boots and my hat and my mask because you have all this pollution, noise and everything. So it's really, really, really challenging. And most people, when I even tell them I'm a leader in the fields, are like, really? What are you doing there (laughter)? BLOCK: So when you watched the film ""Hidden Figures,"" was part of you feeling, I can totally understand what those women must have been going through back then? MBANGSI: Honestly, I cried (laughter). BLOCK: Really? MBANGSI: I cried because I could see myself in mostly every part of the movie because I had the same experience that she had. Like, in the plants, there was no toilet for women. And so I had to actually learn to control myself to make sure that I can only use the toilet when I'm out of the plant. BLOCK: Oh, my goodness. MBANGSI: But the most important thing that actually - in my experience - and I also see in the movie - is the mentoring part. And being the only woman in a room is so tough. But you have to actually show how strong you are. So in the movie, I could just relate in every single step of the way. BLOCK: You mentioned that you cried during the movie. What was it about watching the movie that made you cry? MBANGSI: Honestly, at that moment, I really didn't feel alone anymore because, you know, being in a male-dominated area, sometimes, I actually tend to feel like I'm alone in this whole world. I'm alone in this. But actually seeing what she went through, it's like, you know, Persis, you're not alone in this. She has gone through this many years ago, and she made it. BLOCK: Who was your role model as you were growing up? Who was it who convinced you that you could do this, you could pursue a career in sciences? MBANGSI: And that's where I'm very, very blessed because I have wonderful parents. And they always have this vision of - you can just be the best you can be. Like, pushing so many times. Even when I got into engineering, I wanted to quit. Like, I would call some nights. And I'm like, you know, I really can't do this. It's tough. And just tell me something.

npr,"October 27, 2017",Who Says You Can't Train A Cat? A Book Of Tips For Feline-Human Harmony," This is FRESH AIR. I'm David Bianculli, editor of the website TV Worth Watching, sitting in for Terry Gross. The common wisdom about pets is that you can train a dog, but you can't train a cat. Today's guest says you can train a cat, but it takes an understanding of how cats learn. Sarah Ellis is the co-author with John Bradshaw of the book, ""The Trainable Cat,"" which is now out in paperback. Among the things she's trained her cats to do is come when she calls, voluntarily walk into the cat carrier to go to the vet, take medicine and be friendly to her dog and her baby. Ellis is a feline behavior specialist at the British charity group International Cat Care, which collaborates with organizations around the world involved with cat welfare. She's also a visiting fellow at the University of Lincoln in England. Terry spoke with her last year. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST) TERRY GROSS, HOST:  Sarah Ellis, welcome to FRESH AIR. Why are cats more difficult to train than dogs, and do you even agree with the premise that cats are more difficult to train than dogs? SARAH ELLIS: I think, yes, they can be more difficult, but it's all about having a little bit more patience and a little bit more understanding of what the cat is in terms of its behavior and where it's come from. And then once owners have that understanding, the patience comes much more naturally, and then they can see that training is possible. GROSS: But as you point out, you can't train cats the same way that you train dogs. I mean, it's similar but different because cats respond to different things and they have different sensory ways of intaking information. One of the things you point out is that dogs are creatures of habit, cats are creatures of place. What does that mean? ELLIS: OK, so, yeah, I think the fundamental difference between dogs and cats and how it influences the way that they perceive training is that dogs are innately very, very sociable. They have evolved from a social animal, the wolf, and they are incredibly sociable not just to their own species but to humans. The cat, however, has evolved from a solitary ancestor, the North African wildcat, and that process of domestication has also been much, much shorter, if you like. And therefore, the cat hasn't had the chance to develop these social tendencies that the dog already has. So because of that, the cat's a little bit more on the back foot or the back paw, if you like. They're less likely to understand our - the cues that we may give, for example, things like pointing. They're less likely to naturally attune to us. So they're much less likely to look at our faces, to be able to read our expressions. GROSS: When you say cats are creatures of place, not of habit, what do you mean by that? ELLIS: OK, so going back to this idea that dogs are really sociable and cats less so - because of that, the primary attachment for a dog is generally its owner. By an attachment bond, think of, like, a mother and their child. It's that bond being around - a child to be around its mother creates a feeling of safety and security. And when you go to a new place as a child, as long as your mother or your parent is there, you still feel a sense of safety, and that's the same for a dog. So for when a dog goes to the vet's with its owner, the dog still feels relatively safe and secure and could cope with the environment because its owner's there, that security blanket. For the cats, that security does not necessarily come from a person or another animal. It comes from a physical place. Cats are very, very territorial animals, and they create safety by getting to know a physical place very well and by marking that place and impregnating it with their own scent. So when we take the cat out of that physical environment, we've taken away their safety or their security, and that's why they don't cope nearly as well in novel environments. GROSS: And what are the implications of that for training a cat? ELLIS: Well, the first thing is many of the things that we want to train a cat involve novel places. So you mentioned already going to the vet's, the boarding cattery, moving house, et cetera. And one of the ways that we tend to move cats is we put them in a cat carrier. And so those things are intrinsically stressful for a cat because they're taking them away from their place of safety and security. So the first thing we would want to teach a cat - I think every cat should be taught this as a life skill - is that the cat carrier can become a portable place of safety and security. It is a safe, secure place and is part of the cat's normal territory. And now we have a portable item of security, just like for the dog, its owner, for the cat, its cat carrier. And that's the foundation, I think, for training in terms of novelty. GROSS: So with a cat carrier, to teach the cat that it's a safe place and it's safe to be there when you're taking the cat to a new location, whether it's the airport or the vet, do you keep your carrier out all the time so that it's a very familiar part of the cat's environment, as if it were a piece of furniture in the house? ELLIS: Yeah, absolutely. That's what we would really like to encourage cat owners to do. Currently, what most cat owners do is they keep the cat carrier hidden in a closet or in the basement. And the day that the cat has to go to the vet's, they tend to bring it out. And what that does for the cat is it becomes a very predictive signal that something unpleasant is about to come because they've already made this association between the cat carrier and the travel or the vet's. Instead, as you say, if we keep the cat carrier out all the time, it becomes a regular part of the furniture within their territory. They get the opportunity to facial mark it and to sleep in it and to eat in it, so to have positive experiences within it and also to impregnate their own scent onto it, which is how they feel safe and secure. And therefore it's already a part of their home, so we're taking that place with them when we take them somewhere new. I think the main reason, at the moment, that owners don't do that is that cat carriers don't look particularly pleasant and people don't like the look of them out in their homes. And I think really for - to improve that, we really need to think about nicer, cleaner designs of cat carrier that not only function as a cat carrier but that owners would be happy to leave out in their homes at all time. GROSS: Cats live in the present, and you say any reward or punishment that you use for a cat - and, by the way, you recommend against punishment, and we'll get to that a little bit later - but any reward or punishment should happen immediately after the action. So what kind of problem sets in if you wait a couple of minutes? ELLIS: If you wait a couple of minutes, what you'll, in effect, be rewarding is the behavior that's happening in those couple of minutes later. So cats really, really are a little bit unforgiving, if you like - as are many other animals - in terms of if you are not good with your timing of your training. And by timing, I mean the delivery of the reward because they need to have the two things happening very, very close in time to know that the association is between those two things. And that's classical conditioning. That's not necessarily unique for the cat. That's the same with any animal. So we need to have a message to tell them that was exactly it, right now, right there, what you're doing. If we cannot give the reward at that exact time, and usually the reward is food, we can use other things to pinpoint or reward or mark that behavior that allows the cat to know that food is going to come two minutes later. But the only way you can do that is, first of all, to create an association between whatever your marker behavior is and your reward. So if I give you an example, quite often - let's say we were teaching a cat to go through a cat flap. I couldn't give him the food at the moment that he's going through the cat flap. GROSS: A cat flap is like a cat door, one of those little cat doors. ELLIS: Yeah, a cat door. The behavior that we would want to reward, going through the cat door or jumping down, we cannot give food at that exact moment in time because we might not physically be able to get the food to the other side of the cat door or to the cat the minute its - the second its feet lands on the floor. So we can use something that we call a marker. And in this case, very often with cats, I just use a word, and that word's often just good. But what you have to do before that is teach the cat that the word good predicts that the real reward, the food, is going to come. And you do that just simply by pairing those two things, presenting the word good, so saying it and then giving food. And doing that time again. And then you know the cat has learned the association when you just say the word, good, and the cat orientates towards you. It might meow at you. It shows you all the behaviors that it normally shows you that are indicative that it knows food is on its way. Then you've got a tool that will allow you to buy those extra few seconds, but it's not going to be a few minutes. It's only going to be a few seconds. GROSS: OK, so when you're teaching a cat to respond to a word like good, what exactly is the cat hearing? Do you have any idea? And I have this habit - I don't know if it's annoying to my cat or what, but, I sometimes talk to my cat in a falsetto (imitating high voice) like this. (LAUGHTER) GROSS: I don't know where that comes from, but I don't know, like, is it the rhythm of the word? Is it the, you know, like - our cat's name is Rowdy (ph), and I'll call him like, Rowdy. And, you know, so is he hearing the melody of that sound or, like - what's the best way to talk to a cat? ELLIS: Cats generally cope well with quiet voices. They don't like very loud voices. That can be frightening for them. And they do tend to like female voices a lot because they attune very well to high pitch. Their auditory system is very much designed to hear high-pitch sounds because prey make very, very high-pitch sounds and, therefore, they do tend to orientate towards high sounds better. So I don't think it's a problem at all if owners are speaking to their cats in the more sort of baby-voice-type language. GROSS: You recommend against punishment. You're all for reward. Why is punishment bad? And we're not talking about, you know, beating the cat, but just, like, a negative response like squirting the cat with water or shaking noisy keys at it. ELLIS: Yeah, the reason that we don't advocate punishment at all is because it can be really, really damaging to the relationship of the cat with the human. If you get your timing wrong, you may be punishing a very different behavior to what you think you're punishing, and that can be quite disastrous. And, secondly, if you're delivering that punishment - so you are holding a water sprayer, or you are throwing something at the cat, or you are physically, you know, smacking its back end off the kitchen counter, whatever it is, the cat will associate that punishment with you and may not associate it with the actual act of what it's doing because you're very salient in that environment, at that time, and you are the one delivering the punishment. And so all you're doing then is teaching your cat that you are not a very good person to be around, that you deliver quite unpleasant consequences and, therefore, the cat will start to avoid you rather than stopping to do that behavior. GROSS: So how do you teach a cat not to do something, to stop doing something? ELLIS: So it very much depends on the behavior. But what we would do is try and teach on incompatible behavior. So we would teach the cat to do something else instead that meant they couldn't do the behavior that was undesired. And we would make a different behavior very, very rewarding, so they were very, very motivated to do it. We would also find out what the particular behavior was that they were doing that was undesirable and why they were motivated to do that behavior. And we have to think about is it a behavior that they actually need to do for their own welfare? So, for example, let's say, scratching, and they're scratching the furniture as opposed to scratching on their scratch post. We couldn't just stop that behavior completely because it's a natural behavior for cats, and it's something that they should be allowed to do, and we should accept that they do as part of being a cat. So, therefore, we think we would want to train the cat to redirect that behavior onto something that we would consider much more appropriate, rather than stop it completely. GROSS: Like a scratching post? ELLIS: Like a scratching post, exactly. GROSS: My experience is cats love the furniture and the scratching post. ELLIS: (Laughter). GROSS: You're just adding more joy in their lives, but you're not discouraging them from scratching the things you don't want them to scratch. ELLIS: And, I think, for cats that are housed indoor only, they will often scratch in multiple places within the home because they will often scratch at multiple places within their territory, at the boundary of their territories. So for cats that are allowed outdoor access, that's often outdoors. But for cats that don't have outdoor access, those multiple points are often within the home. So it's a case of educating owners that, actually, one scratch post is often not enough. Most of us just don't have one chair in our house. We have several chairs, and we'll sit in different ones and, therefore, we need to think about being providing extra resources for our cats - more than one scratch post. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Sarah Ellis. She's a cat behavior specialist and co-author of the new book, ""The Trainable Cat."" Let's take a short break, and then we'll talk some more. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF DICK HYMAN AND IVAN DAVIS AND MAURICE PERESS'S ""KITTEN ON THE KEYS"") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR, and if you're just joining us, my guest is Sarah Ellis. She's a cat behavior specialist and her new book, ""The Trainable Cat"" is all about how to train cats. And she says, yes, cats are trainable. OK, so let's start with, like, a basic training thing, teaching a cat to respond to the cat's name and to come when you call it. So as a positive reinforcer, you recommend, you know, a treat. And one of the things you do is have meat paste in a syringe. I mean, I don't even know where to get meat paste. I've never even heard of meat paste. ELLIS: (Laughter) So I... GROSS: Oh, and, by the way, I should mention the syringe, it's not to inject the cat. You just kind of squirt it out of the syringe, and so the cat can lick it off the end of it. There's no needle in it. ELLIS: Yeah, absolutely. GROSS: Is syringe the right word to use? ELLIS: Yeah. Yeah. We would call it a syringe, certainly. And then it's a syringe without a needle, so the plastic part of the syringe, if you like. GROSS: Right. ELLIS: But actually, I have a 2-year-old and during weaning off my little boy, I discovered these, like, squeezy tubes that have a spoon attached to them that you can squeeze the tube, and it squeezes the baby food out onto a spoon. And I thought, these are fantastic for training cats because you can squeeze it straight into a spoon, and the cat licks it off the spoon. So it's amazing what things you can find (laughter) which you're not expecting in life at all. But meat paste - there are some cat food that comes canned, and it's like a patty. And you can loosen that patty with a little bit of water to make paste. And I also have a separate very small food mixer, so that I can blend my cat's regular cat meat into a paste, which it sounds a bit disgusting, but trust me, once you've done it once or twice, it's not a problem. And you can buy human-grade meat paste as well. In the U.K., people spread it on their sandwiches, and these kinds of things. You just have to make sure in the ingredients, it doesn't have any additional ingredients that could be toxic to cats. It's worth definitely checking with your vet. GROSS: Spreading it on sandwiches does not sound great to me, but thanks for the advice. ELLIS: No, it's not. (LAUGHTER) ELLIS: It's not something I would eat (laughter), hence why the cat gets it. GROSS: So getting back to teaching a cat to respond to its name and to come when you call it, walk us through the process for doing that. ELLIS: Sure. GROSS: That seems like the very basic training. ELLIS: Yeah, definitely. So most people's cats know their names already, but where people tend to go wrong is they think, oh, he knows his name. I'll use his name to get him to come to me. But because we use their names all the time, it's not a command to say come to me. It's just a word that we say to them that they know they need to give their attention to us. So the first thing we need to do is think about what word are we going to use that actually means I want you to move your body over towards me and stop when you get to me? We tend to use come or here or any word that works well for you. So the word of the cat - the cat's name, let's say I'm training Cosmos, my cat. I would say the word Cosmos to get his attention, but then I would always say the word come to tell him the command of what I'd like you to do, now I've got your attention, is to come towards me. So you have to think about what that word's going to be, first of all. But we don't use that word until a little bit further down the training. The first thing we do is we make sure the cat is actually really quite close to us when we start teaching the recall. And when I say close, I'm meaning like within a meter or two meters, definitely within the same room. And we show the cat that we have something that it really likes - so most commonly food. And so if you've got your food in the paste, you might need to squirt a little bit of that paste out and let the cat smell it or if you've got food in a tub, if you've got some biscuits, you can rattle that to show the cat that you've got it. The cat should come to you purely because it knows you've got food, and it's motivated for that food. So choose a time when the cat's hungry. Choose a food it really, really likes. So as soon as the cat gets up and starts to walk towards you - and we're only talking, at this stage, a few steps - you then give that cat that reward. And you repeat that in different locations, in different places in the house, and you gradually increase the distance between you and the cat. After doing that in different locations within the house and doing it at different distances which are increasing, we can start to do it when the cat can no longer see us. It can just hear us. And so that's quite good fun. When you really know that you've trained well, you can be in a completely different room of the house, call the cat, give your cue word and see if the cat comes. Only once you've got it that good with it then I take it outdoors. So we're generalizing all the time what the cat's learned to different locations. And that's what makes it really strong. GROSS: So once the cat has mastered this training and comes when you call it by saying come, at what point can you stop giving the cat food each time the cat comes and will the cat at some point think like, well, I'm not going to come any more, there's nothing in it for me? ELLIS: (Laughter) Yeah. OK. So it's a little bit like - imagine the food - it's a little bit like your pay for going to work. We wouldn't go to work for nothing ever, really. There has to be some reward at some point, but that reward doesn't have to come every single time once the animal has learned what the cue word means and has got the behavior mastered. What we tend to find in animal training - and this is not just the case for cats. It's for all animals - is that once you've taught a behavior, in order to maintain that behavioral response really strongly, intermittent reinforcement is the best kind. And by that, what we mean is that you don't give a reward every single time. It sort of keeps the cat guessing. They don't know if running toward you this time will get the food or it will be the next time. And that actually makes the behavior more likely to happen. BIANCULLI: That's Sarah Ellis speaking with Terry Gross. Ellis is the co-author of ""The Trainable Cat,"" which is now out in paperback. We'll hear more of their conversation after a break, and film critic David Edelstein will review ""Novitiate,"" the new movie about an order of nuns set in 1964 during the early years of the Vatican II reforms. I'm David Bianculli, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF ROY HARGROVE'S ""EV'RYBODY WANTS TO BE A CAT"") BIANCULLI: This is FRESH AIR. I'm David Bianculli in for Terry Gross back with more of Terry's interview with feline behavior specialist Sarah Ellis. She' co-author of the book ""The Trainable Cat,"" which is now out in now out in paperback. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST) GROSS: So cats are - they're very demanding about certain things, like when they want food. They know that you feed them and they're hungry, and they want you to feed them. They will tell you either by meowing a lot or by biting your foot or scratching your leg - or there are sweeter ways of doing it than that, but there are the more (laughter) assertive ways. So how do you train a cat to, like, not bite you or scratch you? Oh, let me get to another example. This is the best. When you're sleeping - it's your day to sleep late. It's Saturday. You want to sleep late. Your cat doesn't know it's Saturday. Your cat doesn't care that it's Saturday. It wants to be fed at 6:30 in the morning. And so it jumps onto the bed or walks up to the pillow, sticks its paw in your eye (laughter) and says time to get up. How do you train a cat not to do that? ELLIS: OK, so those behaviors happen in the first place because the cats have trained us. We may not be aware of that at the time, but that's basically what's happened. Cats are not necessarily born meowing and screaming at us for food. It's a behavior that they learn. They're also not born innately to bite our noses when we sleep and scratch our eyes when we sleep. Again, it's another behavior that they try out through trial and error, learn that it has a very, very - it's very effective 'cause it gets exactly the response they would like, and therefore they use it again and again. So the first thing I would say is that owners who have found that their cats are meowing incessantly for food and driving them bonkers is to think about what have you done in the past when your cat has done those behaviors? It is likely that you have gone, oh, goodness me, he's meowing again, just give him some food for him to be quiet. What we've done, remember, is we've reinforced the meowing behavior. So we're just going to make it worse and worse and worse for ourselves 'cause our cats are going to go, oh, that is a behavior that I need to do to get food. And if one day we think, I'm not going to do that anymore, I'm really sick of him meowing for food and I don't want him to do that, I want to try and stop him doing that, and day one, he meows and he meows and you're really strong and you think, no, he's not going to get food for that. And day two and day three - and then by day four, you've had a really, really bad day at work and you're really tired and you've got a bad headache and he is still meowing for food and you think, no, no, I'm going to be strong-willed here. He's not going to get food now. He's going to have to wait until he's quiet another time and then he can have food. And you let him meow for much, much longer than normal, and then you just can't take it anymore and you give him the food. You've made the whole situation even worse because now the cat's learned, oh, I have to meow for, like, 20 minutes instead of 10 minutes for you to give me the food. So what we have to warn owners in that situation is we have to put the behavior on what we call an extinction schedule, if we want to use a real scientific term. That is that this behavior is no longer reinforced. So if you wake me up in the middle of the night, I will no longer get up and feed you just so I can go back to bed. What we need to explain to owners is if they can be really strong with that extinction schedule and just make sure at every occurrence of that behavior they do not reward it, is that it will stop. GROSS: I think a common problem that a lot of pet owners face is that, you know, they have, say, a cat and they want to also adopt another cat or a dog or they have a new baby that's about to arrive, and you have to acclimate the cat that you already have to the newcomer and vice versa. And you have a lot of suggestions for training the cat to deal with the new baby or the new animal that's coming to the house. Can you take us through some of those steps? ELLIS: Yeah, sure. So as humans, we're really naturally very, very sociable. We like extending our families, we like having - if we love cats, we want more cats. The cat doesn't see the world like that at all. Remember, it's evolved from a solitary animal. And so suddenly being asked to share its territory with somebody or something that's very unfamiliar to it can be a real - really quite stressful experience for a cat. So while we might welcome with open arms a new baby or a new cat, and we have an understanding that this already is a family member for us, the cat doesn't. For the cat, it's - the analogy would be like if a - you just came home from work and a stranger was sleeping in your bed. It's really quite a sort of freak-out situation. But when cats - they do have the ability to form social relationships with one another, and it really depends on the individual cat to what extent they can. The way that they do so and the way that they maintain those social relationships is very often through scent, through - they have very, very good sense of smell. And while we generally recognize our family members through sight and through the sound of their voices, for cats, it will be through their - how they smell. So the first thing that we try to do when we're trying to introduce them to a new cat or a new baby, et cetera, is to think about all the sensory information that that new being brings, particularly smell but also sight and sound, and gradually introduce the cat to them over a slow period of time and in a way that the sensory elements are, in their first instance, quite dilute and then come right up to their sort of real level of what they are. GROSS: How do you introduce a new person's smell or a new animal's smell to a cat? ELLIS: OK, so we're going to use an example of a new cat. If we brought a new cat home from the shelter, we would want to keep it in a completely different part of the house from the resident cat, ideally a single room so that that new cat gets a chance to get used to one area that's not too big before we introduce it to other areas. And one of the first ways that we can introduce the two cats to each other's smell is simply by swapping the bedding, taking the bedding that they've been sleeping on, which will be heavily impregnated with their scent, and placing that in each other's territories, making sure that they still have some bedding of their own, as well 'cause, remember, they feel safe and secure when the area smells of them. Cats produce scent, which we cannot detect. Our noses are not strong enough to be able to - or good enough to be able to detect it. And then they also produce these chemicals known as pheromones that are species-specific. So we - they mean nothing to us. We cannot detect them. And they're produced from in between the toes, at the base of the tail, down the flanks but primarily around the face. So do you know under the chin, they love to be scratched and just behind the whiskers on the cheeks, and do you know those areas in front of their ears where there seems to be a lot less hair between the ears and the eyes? GROSS: Yeah. ELLIS: That area there is a very concentrated area where - of sebaceous glands that produce these facial pheromones, these specific chemicals that cats use to communicate with one another. So rubbing a cloth over these facial regions will impregnate that cloth with a scent of that individual cat, which if we smelt that cloth, we would smell nothing. But if we put that into the environment of the other cat, they would very much be able to detect the presence of another cat there. GROSS: And you also have pictures of how you trained your cat at home to accept a second cat. So you have both cats in walled-off spaces but in the same room. So, like, there's some kind of, like, little fence between them or their own - they're each in their own little crates. So they're in the same room, but they're completely protected from each other so that they learn to acclimate to each other without fear of being attacked. ELLIS: Yeah, so once they've got used to the smell of each other and they've heard each other and they're happy with all those things, then we would physically introduce them so that they could see each other. And by this stage, they should be able to recognize each other by smell. So it shouldn't be like, oh, my goodness, who is this creature in my house because they've already smelt this animal and they'll match the smell. But as a safety measure, we would always make sure that they can't physically interact at the beginning beyond just a nose-to-nose greeting. When cats tend to meet each other, they do so by sniffing each other at their noses. And then if they are well-known to one another and part of the same familial group, they may go on to then facial rub. But for cats, when we're introducing them to each other, a nose-to-nose touch or sniff is simply enough that that's all we would be really looking for with no agonistic or hostile behaviors. And so they're able to do this through a barrier, through a mesh door or through a baby gate. But we've prevented the opportunity for any hostile behavior in the eventuality that it did occur because we know from scientific study that if at the first true meeting, cats fight, then the chances of us being able to get those cats to live together is really, really difficult. And the first meeting is really crucial. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Sarah Ellis. She's a cat behavior specialist and co-author of the new book, ""The Trainable Cat."" Let's take a short break here, then we'll talk some more. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF GOLDENBOY'S ""KITTENS OF LUST"") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is cat behavior specialist Sarah Ellis. She's co-author of the new book, ""The Trainable Cat,"" and she insists cats can be trained. A lot of people who have cats have problems with the cat urinating outside of the litter box, and that's an example - like, I have no clue how you would train a cat to not do that. ELLIS: Yeah, the - one of the things is people often think you have to teach a cat to use the litter tray or the litter box, and you don't. You don't have to teach kittens to use the litter box. When they feel a substance under their feet that's very fine and rakable, instinctively they will toilet on it. So the reasons that sometimes they don't use the litter box is because the litter box is not clean enough. Remember, they have this really, really good sense of smell. And while we might not be able to smell the odors coming from it, the cats certainly can. Their noses are closer to the soiled litter and that they have this much better, much more acute sense of smell. And they're fastidious about being clean. So if that litter tray has not been - a litter box has not been scooped in the morning or in the evening, they might choose not to use it. Often, cat litters are designed with us as a consumer in mind rather than our cat, and they are not desirable to our cat in terms of the sensation they create on their feet. They might not be fine and rakable enough or we may place the litter box in an area that the cat doesn't feel is safe and secure. Lots of people put them in their basement next to their tumble dryer or their laundry machine or the washing machine. And for a cat, it's horrible to have that vibration or that noise right next to when they want to go to the bathroom. So these are some of the reasons that cats might not want to use the litter box. There is a whole other range of reasons that are medical related. And so we always, always advise if your cat is not using the litter box, to make sure the first thing you do is to take it to the vet's. So it's not just a simple case of being able to train the cat to use the litter box, it's more that they instinctively know how to do that. It's just that the litter box provided to them is perhaps not desirable because of cleanliness, the substrate that's in it or its location or that it has to share it with another cat. And if those two cats in the home do not consider each other part of their same social group, then they were not going to share a toilet together. GROSS: You know, we're talking about, like, training cats and why that's good for the cat and good for the people. Cats, especially indoor cats, need exercise. And so play is not only, like, a fun activity for the cat and the person but it's also, like, really healthy for the cat. I sometimes wonder if my cat understands that he's engaged in a very Sisyphean activity because (laughter) once - (laughter) like, especially, like, with a laser toy, like, there's no way you're going to actually capture that laser beam, you know? And even with, like, the feather toys - the wand feather toys - like, what do you do with it once you've captured it, you know? You play with it a while and then I'm going to whip it around again and then you capture it again and then I'm going to whip it around again. You know what I'm saying? Like, do cats get frustrated by the ways we play with them? ELLIS: Yeah, they can. And I'll come onto that. But first of all, I think - I'm really pleased you brought up the subject of play 'cause for me, it's not an optional extra in cat ownership. It's not a fun thing to do if you have the time. It is as important as feeding them and providing them with a litter box. It's an absolute basic welfare need, particularly for cats that are indoor-only because the cat, as it's evolved and as we've domesticated it and even as we've selectively bred it and got these pedigree cats, we've never selected to get rid of the predatory behavior and the hunting behavior. And so they still have this desire to perform predatory behavior. And in the wild, they would hunt, you know, approximately 10 times a day. So you imagine they've got this instinct to do this behavior. But in an indoor-only environment, they've got no outlet for it. So really for welfare point of view, we have to offer the cat an appropriate outlet and play is a brilliant, brilliant way of doing that because when they play, they're using exactly the same predatory behaviors. The idea that play could be frustrating for a cat really comes from the idea that we are not allowing the cat to express - or an opportunity to do all of the different predatory behaviors. So if you're chasing a laser beam, a little laser light that's produced from a little box or your cat is chasing feathers on the end of a wand, the chase is only one element of the predatory sequence. There is the locate, the stalk, the stare, the chase, the pounce, which is part of the capture, the killing bite and the consume. And so it's important that we, during play and during feeding, we provide opportunity for all of these behaviors, then we're much, much, much less likely to cause any form of frustration. I think we find it quite amusing when we're playing with cats to make sure that the cat actually can't catch the toy that we're playing with, if it's the feathers on a wand, because then they do these beautiful acrobatics for us as they attempt to catch it. GROSS: Exactly, yes (laughter). ELLIS: But it's so, so important we let them catch it because that is the reward, not every time. Remember, this sort of intermittent reinforcement. They wouldn't catch a mouse every time they hunted. They wouldn't be that good. But we need to think to ourselves when playing with cats, let them catch it now and again, especially when we end a play session. End it on a session where they're allowed to capture it and really have a good chew and bite at it. GROSS: So sometimes what's frustrating for the person is that the cat obviously really wants to play. And you get out the wand toy and you start kind of flipping it around, and the cat is spending, like, minutes just kind of watching it intently. And it's like, come on, play. (LAUGHTER) GROSS: Do something (laughter). ELLIS: Yeah. So quite often what's happening there is that the owner is making the pretend prey, so the feathers on the end of the wand, behave in an unrealistic way that a prey item would not normally. So I've never seen a mouse, for example, you know, fly through the air doing 360 degrees. (LAUGHTER) ELLIS: But yet we expect our cats to chase that and capture that. So it's about teaching owners to make sure that a toy on the end of that wand mimics what a mouse or a bird would do. And then you'll find that the cat really gets engaged. And the more they're allowed to capture it - remember they've been rewarded for that behavior - the more they'll think, this is achievable. I can capture this pretend mouse or pretend bird, but to them, it probably feels real at that moment in time. I'm going to have a shot at going for this one because it's within my ream. So it's just about adjusting our expectations a little bit. GROSS: Sarah Ellis, it's been great to talk with you. Thank you so much. ELLIS: Thank you. It's been a pleasure.

npr,"October 27, 2017",We're Not As Good At Remembering Faces As We Think We Are," Have you ever been in this situation before? Maybe you're at a party. Maybe you're walking down the street. And, suddenly, out of a sea of passing faces, one of them lights up, looking right at you. The person starts waving, maybe says hello. And you have absolutely no clue who this person is. In this encore story, NPR's social science correspondent Shankar Vedantam explains why some of us are really good at recognizing faces and others are not. SHANKAR VEDANTAM, BYLINE: Marty Doerschlag has a superpower that I would love to have. He can remember a face forever. MARTY DOERSCHLAG: If I spend about 30 seconds looking at somebody, I will remember their face for years and years and years. JULIE DOERSCHLAG: His wife, Julie, says one time they were in Las Vegas, sitting down for dinner at a restaurant. And Marty looked at the waiter. He's like, oh, you waited on me in Columbus, Ohio, in X year. The guy just froze. And he said, yeah, you're right. VEDANTAM: Here's the thing. Marty's wife, Julie - she's terrible with faces. J. DOERSCHLAG: I've had a lot of uncomfortable situations forgetting people and have been accused of being a snob. VEDANTAM: Now, you might think that with his gift, Marty could at least be Julie's crutch. But it doesn't always work out that way. J. DOERSCHLAG: Well, sometimes, he doesn't catch me in time. I think we were at one of your friend's apartments. A guy came in, and I went up and hugged him and said, oh, it's so good to see you again. And Marty's friend leaned over and said, why is Julie hugging the caterer? VEDANTAM: So on the facial recognition spectrum, from Marty to Julie, where do most of us fall? MIKE BURTON: I think that nobody really knew until the last few years just how bad we all are with unfamiliar faces. VEDANTAM: This is Mike Burton, a professor of psychology at the University of York in the United Kingdom. He says we're remarkably bad at recognizing the faces of people we don't know very well. To make matters worse, many of us think we're great at it. BURTON: So we set up this little experiment where we asked people to match pairs of faces. They just have to say, are these two faces the same person or not? VEDANTAM: Volunteers were shown faces they were familiar with and faces that were unfamiliar. They were given a matching task where they were given two photos and had to tell if it was the same person. BURTON: We are fantastic at recognizing faces - those faces of people we know. We can recognize our family and friends across a huge range of conditions - you know, distances, in bad light - all kinds. But we falsely assume that this means we're quite good at phrases in general. And, in fact, we're not. VEDANTAM: While it's funny to see our confidence in our own abilities cut down to size, there are serious implications here. BURTON: Even professionals are really bad at it. So we did some work with passport officers last year, where we showed that even passport officers find this a very difficult task and are often inaccurate. VEDANTAM: As bad as most humans can be at recognizing and matching faces, there are some humans who are exceptionally good at it. But for a regular person like Marty Doerschlag back in Washington, D.C., there isn't a huge upside. In fact, it mostly leads to awkwardness. M. DOERSCHLAG: You don't want to make people feel uncomfortable.

npr,"October 27, 2017",South Florida Worries About Possible Dike Failure," RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:  There's a potential crisis building at Florida's Lake Okeechobee. The massive lake is surrounded by an earthen dike, but that barrier that's holding all the water back has been deteriorating. For years, experts have said it is a disaster waiting for high water to happen. And as Peter Haden of member station WLRN tells us now, the water is high. PETER HADEN, BYLINE: Rain from Hurricane Irma and other storms has caused the water in Lake Okeechobee to jump 3 feet. Now the water is above 17 feet, an alarming level not seen in more than a decade. And in the Glades communities, people living around the southern half of the lake, there's concern the dike could collapse. JANET TAYLOR: It's fearful... HADEN: Janet Taylor lives in Clewiston. TAYLOR: ...That if it breach, what is going to happen to us? We are in constant danger if this water keeps rising in Lake Okeechobee. HADEN: One day before the arrival of Hurricane Irma last month, Florida Governor Rick Scott ordered an emergency evacuation of the entire Glades region over fears of flooding from the lake. It was an unprecedented step. TAYLOR: Half of them didn't have the funds to evacuate. And, you know, to just get up one night, go to bed and then wake up the next morning say, you've got to leave, it was devastating to the communities. HADEN: The dike surrounding Lake Okeechobee is 143 miles long. Decades of erosion have weakened it. And for the past 10 years, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has been working to reinforce the dike, but the project isn't scheduled to be done until 2025. So for now, the Corps is doing daily inspections, looking for signs of trouble and fixing them before they get worse. Army Corps District Commander Colonel Jason Kirk says engineers expect the lake to crest soon without major problems. JASON KIRK: If we see any signs of distress, our army team has a plan to do any necessary control of those distressed areas. HADEN: That plan includes having material already in place, dirt and rock and other things, the Corps could use to basically plug the hole if the dike were to breach. But that's not terribly reassuring to the people who live in the shadow of the dike with the specter of the last time it broke. TAMMY JACKSON-MOORE: Thousands and thousands of people perished. HADEN: Tammy Jackson-Moore is a Glades community advocate. In 1928, an earlier version of the dike failed during a massive hurricane. Catastrophic flooding killed more than 2,500 people. JACKSON-MOORE: The bodies started rotting just floating in the water. Some of the bodies were dead amongst other animals and wildlife, some cattle. And that's why you see the mass grave. HADEN: Sixteen hundred people were buried here. It's a grassy plot surrounded by palm trees. It's part of a larger cemetery now. And just about everyone I talked to can name a relative who rests here, including Pastor Albert L. Polk IV. ALBERT L. POLK: We are concerned. You've got so many, many gallons of water that is sitting pressure on a weak dike. HADEN: So when Pastor Polk looks out from his house, beyond his neighbors and his church to the mammoth lake... POLK: I can't swallow all that water, so my first thought is I pray to God that the dam don't break. HADEN: And with hurricane season not ending for weeks, everyone in the Glades is praying the storms don't come. For NPR News, I'm Peter Haden in South Bay, Fla. Copyright © 2017 NPR.

npr,"October 27, 2017",Does Smoking Pot Lead To More Sex?," Tobacco companies put a lot of effort into giving cigarettes sex appeal, but the more sensual smoke might actually belong to marijuana. Some users have said pot is a natural aphrodisiac, despite scientific literature turning up mixed results on the subject. At the very least, a study published Friday in the Journal of Sexual Medicine suggests that people who smoke more weed are having more sex than those who smoke less or abstain. But whether it's cause or effect isn't clear. The researchers pulled together data from roughly 50,000 people who participated in an annual Centers for Disease Control and Prevention survey during various years between 2002 and 2015. ""We reported how often they smoke — monthly, weekly or daily — and how many times they've had sex in the last month,"" says Dr. Michael Eisenberg, a urologist at Stanford University Medical Center and the senior author on the study. ""What we found was compared to never-users, those who reported daily use had about 20 percent more sex. So over the course of a year, they're having sex maybe 20 more times."" Women who consumed marijuana daily had sex 7.1 times a month, on average; for men, it was 6.9 times. Women who didn't use marijuana at all had sex 6 times a month, on average, while men who didn't use marijuana had sex an average of 5.6 times a month. When the researchers considered other potentially confounding factors, such as alcohol or cocaine use, age, religion or having children, the association between more marijuana and more sex held, Eisenberg says. ""It was pretty much every group we studied, this pattern persisted,"" he says. The more marijuana people smoked, the more they seemed to be having sex. Now, that association doesn't necessarily mean the weed is responsible for the heightened sex drive, says Mitch Earleywine, a psychologist at the University at Albany who has studied cannabis and sex but wasn't involved in this work. ""In some surveys, we saw that people [who used cannabis] did have sex more, but it seemed to be mediated by this personality type that's willing to try new things or look for thrills,"" he says. In other words, it seems that people who like to smoke weed may have other character traits that lead them to be lustier. Or maybe it really is the weed. ""It's possible it makes men or women more interested in sex,"" Eisenberg says. In one study, researchers found they were able to induce sexual behavior by injecting a cannabinoid, the class of psychoactive compounds in marijuana, into rats. But people aren't rats, of course. Another study published in 2012 found that women became more aroused when watching erotic films when they had cannabinoids in their system. But that might just be because weed seems to heighten sensory experiences overall. ""It gets people to appreciate the moment more anyway,"" psychologist Earleywine says. ""They like food more, find humor in things more easily, so it wouldn't be stunning to think they would enjoy sex more."" Whatever the connection, Eisenberg says his results leads him to think that pot, unlike tobacco which can depress libido and performance, isn't going to take the steam out of one's sex drive. ""One question my patients always have is will smoking marijuana frequently negatively impact my sexual function?"" Eisenberg says. ""We don't want people to smoke to improve sexual function, but it probably doesn't hurt things."" Not everyone agrees with that conclusion. ""It's a lot of stretch here,"" says Dr. Rany Shamloul, a researcher at Ottawa Hospital in Canada who focuses on sexual health and function. He didn't work on the latest study. In an odd Catch-22, Shamloul says that recent research suggests cannabis might actually make it harder for a man's penis to become erect, even if weed might turn people on. ""Recent studies have shown cannabinoid receptors in the penis itself, and experiments in the lab show an inhibitory response,"" he says. ""There was basically a mixed result. Cannabis might increase [sexual arousal] frequency in the brain, but also decrease erectile function in the penis."" There is another issue that may throw cold water on cannabis' potential as a love enabler. A frequent side effect of marijuana is a dry mouth, and University at Albany's Earleywine points out that one's mouth might not be the only thing turning arid. ""Drying of the mucus membranes is a pretty consistent effect of the plant. Women should keep that in mind when considering cannabis as a sexual aid. I know that some products have THC or cannabinoids in a lubricant, but I haven't seen any actual data on that,"" he says. Stanford's Eisenberg says his study doesn't prove the idea that marijuana is getting people into the sack, though he says that is a possibility. There's really only one conclusion he can safely draw from the work: Cannabis users are doing it more. Shots is the online channel for health stories from the NPR Science Desk.

npr,"October 26, 2017",Scientists Spot First Alien Space Rock In Our Solar System," Astronomers have spotted some kind of outer space rock that's the first visitor from outside of our solar system that they've ever observed. The discovery has set off a mad scramble to point telescopes at this fast-moving object to try to learn as much as possible before it zips out of sight. ""Now we finally have a sample of something from another solar system, and I think that's really neat, "" says Karen Meech, an astronomer at the University of Hawaii Institute for Astronomy, ""and so you'd love to see if it looks like stuff in our solar system."" It's long been assumed that an interstellar object like this one should be out there, because giant planets in forming solar systems are thought to toss out bits of space crud that haven't yet glommed into anything. But this is the first time scientists have actually found one. The mysterious object is small — less than a quarter mile in diameter — and seems to have come from the general direction of the constellation Lyra, moving through interstellar space at 15.8 miles per second, or 56,880 miles per hour. ""The orbit is very convincing. It is going so fast that it clearly came from outside the solar system,"" says Paul Chodas, manager of NASA's Center for Near-Earth Object Studies at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. ""It's whipping around the Sun, it has already gone around the Sun, and it has actually gone past the Earth on its way out."" The asteroid was discovered on October 19 by Hawaii's Pan-STARRS 1 telescope, which searches the sky for near-Earth objects. ""It became clear that it didn't move like asteroids and comets normally do,"" says Robert Weryk of the University of Hawaii, who contacted a colleague to acquire follow-up images using another telescope owned by the European Space Agency. The combined observations made it clear that this was an interstellar visitor. The asteroid is now speeding toward the constellation Pegasus and is fading out of sight fast. ""We might have, for moderately large telescopes, another handful of days, maybe a couple of weeks. So we don't have much time to study it,"" says Meech, who wants to know what its shape is and what its chemical composition might be. She says the Hubble Space Telescope should spy on this object as well, in the coming weeks. She notes that different stars have different chemical compositions, so she'd like to know if the solar system this came from produces material similar to the planet-making stuff in our own. ""We've been expecting this for decades, really,"" says Chodas. ""We don't know enough about how much material is floating around between the stars. And so this will give us the first data point. We hope to find more of this stuff."" The Two-Way is the place to come for breaking news, analysis and for stories that are just too interesting – or too entertaining – to pass up.

npr,"October 26, 2017",Skull Is Potentially From The Oldest Known Victim Of A Tsunami," Researchers in Australia, New Zealand and the U.S. say they've potentially identified the ""oldest known tsunami victim in the world."" It's not from a new discovery, but from researching the sediment in the area where an ancient skull was discovered in 1929. Geologist Paul Hossfeld discovered the ""Aitape Skull"" in northern Papua New Guinea that year and believed it to be from a species called Homo erectus, an early relative of humans that lived more than 1 million years ago. But it was later ""radiocarbon dated"" to being only about 6,000 years old. Researchers James Goff, Mark Golitko, Ethan Cochrane, Darren Curnoe, Shaun Williams and John Terrell said they ""conclude that the skull was laid down in a tsunami deposit and as such may represent the oldest known tsunami victim in the world. These findings raise the question of whether other coastal archaeological sites with human skeletal remains would benefit from a re-assessment of their geological context."" The study was published in the journal PLoS ONE on Wednesday. The researchers traveled in 2014 to the same area of northern Papua New Guinea where Hossfeld discovered the skull 85 years earlier — ""along the foothills of the Torricelli Mountains some 12 km inland from Sissano Lagoon."" It was also the site of heavy damage from a major tsunami in 1998 that killed more than 2,000 people. ""[T]he unique introduction of marine sediments that encased the Aitape Skull is consistent with conditions reported following the 1998 PNG tsunami,"" the researchers write. It was evidence that the skull was from an individual killed in a tsunami about 6,000 years ago. The New York Times offered this explanation: ""Because they had previously analyzed geochemical signals from sediment on the island following the 1998 tsunami, the team knew which clues to look for, like grain size and composition. ""They found that the sediment collected from the skull site contained fossilized deep sea diatoms. These microscopic organisms were a telltale sign that ocean water had drowned the area at some point. ""The researchers also found geochemical signals that matched the signatures they collected in 1998, offering additional evidence that a tsunami had struck around 6,000 years ago."" The researchers say the finding shows that ""tsunamis may have contributed to a much more dynamic world of community and individual mobility"" among those alive during the period, in turn leading to ""wider-ranging social ties, and ... the spread of materials and new ideas and practices"" in the southwest Pacific during the period several thousand years ago.

npr,"October 26, 2017","When The State Sinks, Science Is The Anchor"," As Europe was being torn apart in the early 17th century by conflicts between Catholics and Protestants — that would lead to the devastating Thirty Years War in 1618 — the German astronomer Johannes Kepler wrote: ""When the storm rages and the shipwreck of the state threatens, we can do nothing more worthy than to sink the anchor of our peaceful studies into the ground of eternity."" The state was crumbling under the chaotic leadership of the mad Holy Roman Emperor Rudolph II, while different religious factions vied for power. There was no trust, institutions were failing. In Italy, the Church was tightening its grip on free thinking, as it fought the Reformation. In 1616, Galileo was admonished by Cardinal Bellarmine, Master of Controversial Questions of the Roman College, who challenged him to either furnish real proof that the Earth revolved around the sun or to stay silent. Kepler and Galileo feared for their lives, but wouldn't renounce their freedom to ponder the workings of nature. Each pushed his research program forward, culminating in the complete upheaval of the Aristotelian worldview later in the same century. Their heroic deeds opened the doors to the modern world. Religious repression and wars pass, but scientific knowledge remains. We don't live in the 17th century, but we would be naïve to think that science and its credibility isn't under attack. We witness it every day, as many politicians and non-experts challenge the careful findings of hundreds of scientists in topics ranging from the worth of vaccination to climate change. It is paradoxical that this is happening here in America, a country that defined itself, at least until recently, by its scientific and technological prowess: the telephone; the light bulb; mechanized agriculture; machine automation in factories; atomic bombs and nuclear energy; the laser; people on the moon; personal computers; economic giants Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Tesla, SpaceX; more Nobel prizes than any other country by far (353 versus 125 from the UK, with the second most), the list goes on and on. How could this be? This is a crucial question, one that we should all be thinking about. Many political leaders don't know science, and don't seem to take an interest in it. There is only one Congressman with a science Ph.D., Bill Foster, a Democrat from Illinois. Having taught science and non-science majors in an elite university for 26 years, I see a clear divide between students that like and don't like math and the sciences, in general. There are, of course, exceptions, and this is only anecdotal evidence but, excepting students interested in patent and environmental law, most who decide to go to law school are not the ones with strong affections for the STEMS disciplines. It would be interesting to have a quantitative study on how this affects their late careers and positions on scientific issues, especially those who end up in politics. Under pressure from lobbying interests, the results of careful scientific research become politicized and ""open for public debate."" Suddenly, even if you know nothing of the careful scientific methodology used to obtain a result or to reach a certain conclusion, you become entitled to a contrarian opinion based on — based on what, exactly? On hearsay and propaganda from interest groups that manipulate public opinion to serve their own purposes — usually to safeguard the bottom line for their stockholders. The result is that scientific research and its outcomes — carefully crafted by thousands of experts across the world who spent years, decades, in training — become open for public debate as if we were talking about football, movies, or fashion. It is as if the surgeon became the judge and the judge became the engineer. People confuse the process of doing science — self-correcting, always improving — with imprecision and uncertainty. That's a serious mistake. Science does advance in stages, as we strive to understand the workings of nature and to adapt this knowledge to the development of technologies that will improve our quality of life. But it does advance — and we see the results of this advance everywhere. Just think of what you would find 10 years ago in a store like Best Buy and what you find there now. OLED TVs? Smart phones? Ultra-accurate GPS? Where do these come from? Who makes them? Not the politicians or others who distrust science, that's for sure. They just use these devices, taking the amazing science behind them for granted. Kepler witnessed the state collapsing around him, and felt helpless. He couldn't pick up a sword to fight, for he was a hero of ideas and not of bloody battles. Instead, he looked up. And so did Galileo. And what they saw, and their diligence in pursuing the truth, changed the world forever. How many potential Keplers and Galileos are out there today in grade school, growing up confused about the value of a scientific education? There are wonderful schools and teachers doing a first-rate job, and families that take an interest in the key scientific issues of our time and share them with their children. But there is also much obscurantism, and distrust of science. I fear for our children's safety, mine included, in a world run by adults that don't understand what they are doing to it. At least, as history has shown, political and ideological repression passes, but scientific knowledge remains. Let us work to ensure that the damage is not irreversible.

npr,"October 26, 2017",Court To Rule On Whether Relapse By An Addicted Opioid User Should Be A Crime," Julie Eldred is back at home in Massachusetts now. But she was sentenced to a treatment program for opioid addiction as part of a probation agreement, then sent to jail when she relapsed. Some addiction specialists say that's unjust. Julie Eldred has been struggling with addiction to opioids for more than a decade and she says the criminal justice system punishes her for it. Eldred, a part-time pet caretaker in Acton, Mass., was put on probation last year for theft. She knew staying drug-free would be tough — especially at first, when she was going through opioid withdrawal. But, she says, she didn't have much of a choice. ""I was in the midst of active addiction, so I was actively using. But you're forced to go into this saying I'll be drug-free or you go to jail,"" Eldred says. She complied with her probation conditions, she says — she found outpatient treatment, addiction medication and a therapist — but she failed a drug test. Eldred told her probation officer that she had just started treatment and had relapsed, but was now back on track. Eldred says her probation officer didn't care. ""She didn't look at that picture,"" Eldred says. ""She didn't look [to see] that I had just gotten started getting everything in order. She just saw that I had a 'dirty urine,' and she just sent me in front of the judge to go to jail."" The judge sentenced Eldred to jail for the probation violation; Eldred says she received no treatment. ""I had a cellmate in there for murder, but she wasn't sentenced yet,"" Eldred says. ""You're with people who know they're going to be sentenced and they know they're going to be in there a long time, so they don't care. There is a lot of violence — girls will jump you. It's scary."" Ten days later, Eldred was released from jail when her lawyer found a bed in a residential treatment facility. That lawyer — Lisa Newman-Polk — brought Eldred's case to Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, arguing that the courts should not punish people for having the disease of addiction. ""This idea that a court can order a person to stop using — with the threat of punishment — is not grounded in reality,"" Newman-Polk says. ""If it worked to punish people for addiction and relapse we would have a cured nation."" Newman-Polk argues that courts should take into account scientific research about addiction, and apply it in practice — much as courts have done with the science about brain development and juvenile offenders. She says addiction is a medical condition, so it's unconstitutional to incarcerate someone for relapsing — because that's part of the disease. ""An order to be drug-free is an order that a person with a substance use disorder needs to be in remission or cured of addiction. It's not practical or reasonable, in view of what we know about the brain science and what we know about addiction,"" Newman-Polk says. The science of addiction is mentioned in all the legal briefs filed in this case — many focus on what research says about how much control patients like Eldred have over their drug use, and whether consequences like jail actually motivate patients to stop using. A brief from the Massachusetts Medical Society says relapse is a symptom of addiction that needs to be treated, not punished. ""Even Lindbergh bounced down the runway a couple of times before he became airborne,"" says Massachusetts Medical Society President Dr. Henry Dorkin, ""and we would not want to incarcerate people at the first sign of relapse if we're treating this as a chronic disease."" But the opposing briefs argue that there is not consensus about whether addiction is a brain disease that leaves someone powerless over drug use. The National Association of Drug Court Professionals says supervision and drug testing help keep people in recovery. It says specialty drug courts are effective and already work to get help for addicted defendants, rather than incarcerate them. It warns the Massachusetts court not to allow ""any particular theory of addiction to influence its decision."" 
                Eldred, at home with her dog, Bubbles, says she's committed to her recovery from opioid addiction. ""But,"" she adds, ""I can't say that I won't ever relapse again. Right now I feel strong, but this is a lifelong journey.""

 Eldred, at home with her dog, Bubbles, says she's committed to her recovery from opioid addiction. ""But,"" she adds, ""I can't say that I won't ever relapse again. Right now I feel strong, but this is a lifelong journey."" One of those writing on that side is Gene Heyman, a senior lecturer in psychology at Boston College. He cites studies that say that many people stop using drugs and alcohol on their own — oftentimes because they face negative consequences if they don't. ""The empirical question at stake is, if you ask someone not to use drugs and you provide a reason not to use, can the person respond ?"" Heyman says. ""And the data say yes they can — they can stop using drugs."" The Massachusetts attorney general points out that Eldred was on probation for theft — and that she did eventually go into drug treatment because otherwise she would go to jail. During the state's supreme court hearing on the case this month, the justices asked tough questions of both sides. Justice Barbara Lenk asked Newman-Polk where judges should draw the line if someone can't control their behavior. ""Now, if somebody didn't have the ability to resist the urge to use drugs, how is it that she could resist the urge to commit other petty crimes in order to support her drug habit ? How is it that she could have the self-control to continue in a treatment program that presumably doesn't want her to use drugs?"" Lenk asked. Crimes should be punished, Newman-Polk responded, but committing crimes is not a symptom of addiction. Maria Granik, a Massachusetts assistant attorney general, argued for the state, saying that addiction is not a defense for a probation violation or for criminal responsibility in general. Granik also argued that incarceration is one tool judges can use if necessary. But what if a judge decided to use the probation violation to sentence Eldred for the underlying crime of larceny, Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court Chief Justice Ralph Gantz asked Granik. ""What you need to come to grips with — and I don't hear it frankly,"" Gantz went on, ""is, is it appropriate for a judge under these circumstances, recognizing that relapse routinely occurs in these circumstances, to impose a two-and-a-half-year sentence in the House of Correction for her probation violation?"" ""I don't think we could go that far,"" Granik answered. Gantz says the high court will likely issue guidelines for all courts so judges can determine how to handle what has become a revolving door in the criminal justice system for those addicted. ""This is a really challenging issue, and each side needs to come to grips with it, because judges have to do this each and every day,"" Gantz says. The Massachusetts Bar Association expects the high court's ruling will cause state lawmakers to fund more addiction treatment. Martin Healy, the association's chief legal counsel and chief operating officer, believes the ruling will set a precedent. ""It is probably going to be one of the most important cases that our court will bring down — over the last decade,"" Healy says. ""And I think it will result in some dramatic changes to the way that society treats addiction.""  As for Julie Eldred, she is no longer on probation and says she's committed to working on her recovery. ""Hopefully this is it,"" Elred says. ""But I can't say that I won't ever relapse again. Right now I feel strong, but this is a lifelong journey. Some people think you get clean and that should be it. It's not."" A ruling from Massachusetts highest court is expected by spring.

npr,"October 26, 2017",Monsanto Attacks Scientists After Studies Show Trouble For Weedkiller Dicamba," In a normal year, Kevin Bradley, a professor of weed science at the University of Missouri, would have spent his summer testing new ways to control a troublesome little plant called water hemp. This has not been a normal year. ""I don't even talk about weed management anymore,"" Bradley tells me, and he sounds disgusted. ""Nobody calls me and ask me those questions. I barely have time to even work with my graduate students. Everything is about dicamba. Every single day."" Dicamba, an old weedkiller that is being used in new ways, has thrust Bradley and a half-dozen other university weed scientists into the unfamiliar role of whistleblower, confronting what they believe are misleading and scientifically unfounded claims by one of the country's biggest seed and pesticide companies: Monsanto. ""It's not comfortable. I'm like anybody else, I don't like [it when] people are unhappy with me,"" says Mike Owen, a weed specialist at Iowa State University. Then he chuckles. ""But sometimes, like John Wayne said, a man's got to do what a man's got to do!"" ""Certainly, there's not a weed scientist in any of these states who would back down, who would change their story,"" says Aaron Hager, at the University of Illinois. The tensions between Monsanto and the nation's weed scientists actually began several years ago, when Monsanto first moved to make dicamba the centerpiece of a new weedkilling strategy. The company tweaked the genes in soybeans and cotton and created genetically modified varieties of those crops that can tolerate doses of dicamba. (Normally, dicamba kills those crops.) This allowed farmers to spray the weedkiller directly on their soybean or cotton plants, killing the weeds while their crops survived. It's an approach that Monsanto pioneered with crops that were genetically modified to tolerate glyphosate, or Roundup. After two decades of heavy exposure to glyphosate, however, devastating weeds like Palmer amaranth, or pigweed, developed resistance to it. So farmers are looking for new weedkilling tools. Dicamba, however, has a well-known defect. It's volatile; it tends to evaporate from the soil or vegetation where it has been sprayed, creating a cloud of plant-killing vapor that can spread in unpredictable directions. It happens more in hot weather, and Monsanto's new strategy inevitably would mean spraying dicamba in the heat of summer. Monsanto and two other chemical companies, BASF and DuPont, announced that they had solved this problem with new ""low-volatility"" formulations of dicamba that don't evaporate as easily. Yet the companies — especially Monsanto — made it difficult for university scientists to verify those claims with independent tests before the products were released commercially. ""I wish we could have done more testing. We've been asking to do more testing for several years, but the product was not made available to us,"" says Bob Scott, a weed scientist at the University of Arkansas. ""These are proprietary products. Until they release those formulations for testing, we're not allowed to [test them]."" To make matters worse, Monsanto started selling its new dicamba-tolerant soybeans in 2016, before the new low-volatility formulations of dicamba were even approved for sale. It tempted farmers to use older versions of dicamba on these crops, illegally, and some farmers couldn't resist that temptation. In Arkansas, there were widespread reports that dicamba was damaging neighboring fields that didn't have the benefit of Monsanto's new genes. In one case, a dispute between farmers led to a fatal shooting. That fall, at a meeting of weed scientists, Hager confronted Monsanto's representatives. According to Hager, he told the company that ""you knowingly released these varieties in an area of the U.S. where you knew that glyphosate resistance [in weeds] was rampant. When you did that ... you knew what was going to happen."" ""I got a blank stare,"" Hager recalls. This past summer, the floodgates on dicamba use opened. The new formulations of dicamba were approved for use (although Arkansas only allowed farmers to use BASF's product, not Monsanto's) and farmers rushed to adopt the new technology. They planted dicamba-tolerant crops on 26 million acres. 
                A farmer's nightmare weed, glyphosate-resistant Palmer amaranth, or pigweed, sprouts in a soybean field in Arkansas. Its evolution has farmers looking for new weedkilling strategies.

 ""The demand for it is overwhelming. The need to control these difficult-to-manage weeds is huge,"" says Scott Partridge, Monsanto's vice president of global strategy. When spraying started, complaints rolled in. The new ""low volatility"" versions of dicamba didn't stay where they belonged. They drifted into nearby fields, damaging crops there — mostly soybeans, but also vegetables and orchards. There were reports of damage from Mississippi to Minnesota, but the problem was worst in Arkansas, Missouri and Tennessee. ""By the end of May, first of June, it became impossible; the calls were coming in, three or four a day. Sometimes eight or 12 a day,"" says the University of Arkansas' Scott. ""There is no precedent for what we've seen this year."" At first, the companies selling these herbicides — both Monsanto and BASF — seemed unconcerned. ""All I got was denial that there was a problem,"" Bradley says. ""What I kept hearing was: It's not a big problem nationwide; we always have these kinds of mistakes or accidents with the introduction of any new technology."" So Bradley, a past president of the Weed Science Society of America, started collecting data on crop damage from across the country, mapping the epidemic. By the end of the summer, Bradley estimated that at least 3.1 million acres of crops had shown some injury from drifting dicamba. With the scale of dicamba damage increasingly clear, a fierce debate erupted over its cause. Monsanto's executives insist that the people who sprayed dicamba were just learning how to do it properly and didn't follow directions. Partridge says his company checked out more than a thousand cases of dicamba damage, ""and in 88 percent of those instances, the label was not followed."" Farmers or pesticide applicators sprayed dicamba too close to neighboring fields, didn't clean out their equipment properly or used the wrong nozzles. ""Every one of those [mistakes] is fixable by education,"" Partridge says. University weed scientists say that that is only part of the explanation and that the problem can't be fixed so easily. Bradley, Scott and their colleagues in other states say that much of the damage they saw this year didn't appear to come from ""physical drift"" of windblown droplets of dicamba, coming directly from a sprayer. Physical drift, they say, typically produces a plume of damage that diminishes with distance from the source of the spray. Instead, they saw entire hundred-acre fields of soybeans with cupped leaves, and the damage was uniform from one end to the other. They also saw damage in orchards and fields that were far removed from any fields sprayed with dicamba. This pattern, they say, looks more like what they had feared all along: volatilization. 
                Lyle Hadden, a soybean farmer, holds leaves and a stalk from a soybean plant in a field he planted that shows signs of being affected by dicamba.

 What is more, the scientists say, field experiments that they finally carried out this summer point toward evaporating dicamba as a cause. Bob Scott shows me one such experiment, a field of soybeans at a research station near Lonoke, Ark. Here, soybeans were injured by dicamba that definitely did not enter the field through mistakes in spraying. ""It's important to remember, we did not spray this plot,"" Scott says. Instead, at a location far away from this field, he and his colleagues sprayed trays of soil with various dicamba-containing herbicides. Then they carried the trays into this field and placed them between the rows of soybeans for 48 hours. The trays and soybeans were protected underneath plastic hoops — essentially, miniature greenhouses — that were open at each end. The dicamba evaporated from the trays and injured the soybean plants nearby, curling their leaves and stunting their growth. ""A lot of people were very disappointed when they saw the plots,"" Scott says. ""A lot of people didn't want to see what they were seeing, and were in disbelief."" These observations have huge implications. If the new formulations of dicamba evaporate and spread, they cannot easily be controlled. ""If this were any other product, I feel like it would be just pulled off the market, and we'd be done with it,"" Scott says. But dicamba, and the crops created to tolerate it, aren't just any products. There is big money behind them. Monsanto, seed dealers, farmers who are struggling with weed problems — they all have a stake in this technology. The university scientists who are pointing out problems with them are confronting an economic juggernaut.  Monsanto — and farmers who want to use dicamba — have been fighting back. In Arkansas, where state regulators proposed a ban on dicamba during the growing season next year, Monsanto recently sued the regulators, arguing that the ban was based on ""unsubstantiated theories regarding product volatility that are contradicted by science."" The company called on regulators to disregard information from Jason Norsworthy, one of the University of Arkansas' weed researchers, because he had recommended that farmers use a non-dicamba alternative from a rival company. Monsanto also attacked the objectivity of Ford Baldwin, a former university weed scientist who now works as a consultant to farmers and herbicide companies. ""I read it as an attack on all of us, and anybody who dares to [gather] outside data,"" Scott says. ""And some of my fellow weed scientists read it that way as well."" Bradley says executives from Monsanto have made repeated calls to his supervisors. ""What the exact nature of those calls [was], I'm not real sure,"" Bradley says. ""But I'm pretty sure it has something to do with not being happy with what I'm saying."" I contacted three academic deans at the University of Missouri, asking for details about the calls. A university spokesman said they were too busy to respond. Monsanto's Partridge says, ""We are not attacking Dr. Bradley. We respect him, his position, opinion, and his work. We respect him, and academics in general."" Bradley says criticism from people in Missouri's farming community whom he has known for years hits him even harder. ""To have somebody say that what [I'm] saying is bad for Missouri agriculture, that's a hard one to take,"" he says. ""There's not a lot of glory in these positions, or major financial incentive. We chose these jobs to help the farmers in our states."" Monsanto's explanation for what happened this summer, and how to prevent it, seems to be carrying the day in Washington, D.C. Two weeks ago, the Environmental Protection Agency announced that it will allow continued use of dicamba next year. The EPA is imposing a few additional restrictions on who can spray it, and when. Those restrictions will have little effect, or none at all, on damage caused by volatilization. Arkansas' proposal to ban use of dicamba during the growing season next summer has not yet received final approval. A public hearing on the proposal is set for Nov. 8. Kevin Bradley thinks there is one positive result from the controversy. ""It has made more farmers aware of what we do, and that is, unbiased research and calling it like we see it,"" he says. Over the course of recent decades, publicly funded agricultural extension services have shrunk, and farmers have turned to seed and chemical companies for advice. ""It's become so weighted towards — 'well, the companies did their research, and it said this, so that must be the way it is!' "" Bradley says. ""You know what? Maybe that's not the way it is.""

The four-year-old male, known as OR-33, was found dead in late April in southwestern Oregon's Fremont-Winema National Forest, according to the agency. A necropsy confirmed that it was OR-33, which had a collar that had stopped working the previous year. The wolf died of gunshot wounds. ""This is a heartbreaking loss for Oregon's wolves,"" Amaroq Weiss, West Coast wolf advocate at the Center for Biological Diversity, said in a statement. ""Wolf recovery in Oregon depends on wolves like OR-33 making their way west and thriving, so his death is a major setback.""  Gray wolves are listed as endangered in the western part of Oregon. ""The federal offense is punishable by up to a $100,000 fine, a year in jail, or both. The maximum state penalty is a fine of $6,250 and a year in jail,"" according to The Associated Press. OR-33 was a lone wolf, having left the Imnaha pack in northeastern Oregon in 2015, the Fish and Wildlife Service said.  Last year, ""OR-33 roamed almost within Ashland city limits — a city of more than 20,000. From June 10-12, he attacked and killed two goats and one lamb at a small livestock operation northeast of Ashland,"" the Statesman Journal reported, citing the agency. The animal was apparently not subtle. ""This wolf is acting like David Lee Roth,"" Greg Roberts, a media personality in Southern Oregon, told the Statesman Journal last year. ""I had eight people in Ashland say that they've seen him around their property."" Oregon had at least 112 wolves in 2016, according to state statistics. But the conservation groups contributing to the reward for information say that ""since 2015 at least eight wolves have been poached or died under mysterious circumstances in Oregon."" Quinn Read, Northwest representative of Defenders of Wildlife, said poaching in Oregon is ""a huge and growing problem."" She added: ""We need everyone's help to catch this killer.""

npr,"October 25, 2017",Troubling History In Medical Research Still Fresh For Black Americans," It's a Sunday morning at the Abyssinian Baptist Church, a famous African-American church in the Harlem area of New York City. The organist plays as hundreds of worshippers stream into the pews. The Rev. Calvin O. Butts III steps to the pulpit. ""Now may we stand for our call to worship,"" says Butts, as he begins a powerful three-hour service filed with music, dancing, prayers and preaching. ""How good and pleasant it is when all of God's children get together."" Then, about an hour into the service, Butts does something he has never done before. ""I would like to introduce the Precision Medicine Initiative,"" he says, referring to a huge new project sponsored by the National Institutes of Health. It's now called All of Us. ""It is a landmark longitudinal research effort that aims to engage 1 million participants of all ethnicities to improve our ability to prevent and treat disease based on individual differences in lifestyle, environment and genetic makeup,"" Butts says. Why is this famous preacher at this famous African-American church talking about a big government medical study in the middle of Sunday service? To understand that, I visit a clinic more than 30 blocks away at Columbia University. That's where I meet Anne and Steve Halliwell of Irvington, N.Y., who just volunteered for the study. 
                Steve Halliwell (left), a volunteer in the study, has his height measured for a second time by Dan Nguyen, a research assistant involved in the All of Us research initiative.

 Steve Halliwell (left), a volunteer in the study, has his height measured for a second time by Dan Nguyen, a research assistant involved in the All of Us research initiative. ""Sorting out the huge variation in the human race is very, very important — and is the future of good medicine,"" Steve Halliwell says. The Halliwells spend the next hour learning about the project and answering detailed questions about their lifestyles, medical history and health. They also get their blood pressure, height, weight and waists measured and have blood drawn so scientists can get a sample of their DNA. Anne Halliwell is 67; Steve is 74. They're white. And that's the problem: White people like the Halliwells are much more likely than black people to volunteer for medical studies. The reasons are complicated. One is that African-Americans may not get the chance as often — they just aren't asked by their doctors or don't have the time or resources to volunteer. But another is that medical research has a long, troubled racial history. One example is the Tusgekee study, which involved doctors letting black men die from syphilis. Another example is the case of Henrietta Lacks. She was a poor African-American woman whose cancer cells scientists and drug companies used for decades without her permission. But the list of abuses is long. So the National Institutes of Health and others have been trying to overcome all that, in part by working with groups like the Abyssinian Baptist Church. ""This research is not like the Tuskegee experiment,"" Butts tells his congregation. ""And it is supported by some members of the Henrietta Lacks family."" ""It's for all ethnicities,"" he says. ""And you can bet your life that white folk are in this. They want to know what's gonna keep 'em alive. And we ought to know what's going to keep us alive."" 
                The Abyssinian Baptist Church partnered with researchers on the All of Us project, allowing them to set up an information table at a block party following a Sunday church service.

 The Abyssinian Baptist Church partnered with researchers on the All of Us project, allowing them to set up an information table at a block party following a Sunday church service. As the service ends and the parishioners file out of the church, they find a block party starting outside. At one of the folding tables lining the block, researchers from the NIH, Columbia and two other New York hospitals are answering questions. ""So what is this?"" one parishioner asks. ""So you're doing research — tell me about this."" ""It's really a unique program,"" says Kolbi Brown, the project's program manager at the Harlem Hospital. ""Our goal is to get participants — a diverse range of participants. So we want women. We want minorities. We want everybody. But we really want women and minorities to participate in this community, of course."" Many people at the block party are enthusiastic. ""I can't wait for this program to start,"" says Joanne Thigpen, who lives in Harlem. ""I'm very excited about it for myself and my children."" But some are wary. Deborah Fleming listens patiently but then declines an invitation to sign up. ""As an African-American, I know that sometimes these things are used against us — not to our advantage,"" says Fleming, who lives in Dutchess County, N.Y. ""So that's why I'm reticent about joining."" 
                Deborah Fleming declined to provide her contact information during the block party. She says she hesitated because of abuses of African-Americans that have occurred during medical research in the past.

 Deborah Fleming declined to provide her contact information during the block party. She says she hesitated because of abuses of African-Americans that have occurred during medical research in the past. Benjamin Vines Jr., 64, who was enjoying the party down the street, has similar feelings. ""It reminds me of the Tuskegee-type thing,"" he says. ""And in my culture, African-Americans are scared of the doctor. They don't go to the doctor until the last minute — until we're almost on our deathbed — simply because of that."" A new poll by NPR, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health found that about a third of African-Americans say they have experienced discrimination at a doctor's office or health clinic. The poll also found that 1 in 5 African-Americans avoids medical care because of concern about discrimination. At first, I thought it was only older parishioners who feel that way. Hortensia Gooding, a 45-year-old graduate student who lives in Harlem, set me straight. ""I see my friends mentioning Tuskegee all the time on Facebook,"" Gooding says. ""There's a lot of deep, deep-seated fear and concern that black lives don't matter and that the medical community really will harm people of African descent on purpose — just for profit or just to help someone from another race."" And some people's reluctance has nothing to do with Tuskegee or Lacks. Don't forget: The study is asking volunteers to give up a sample of their DNA. ""No. Not my DNA — I can't,"" says 51-year-old Clerance Johnson Jr., who also lives in Harlem. ""I don't know what they might use it for,"" he says. ""It might link me to something I don't want to be linked to — any criminal activities."" So the question remains: Will the help of the Abyssinian Baptist Church — and others — be enough to overcome these deep suspicions and other obstacles that prevent minorities from participating in medical research? This story is part of our ongoing series, ""You, Me and Them: Experiencing Discrimination in America.""

npr,"October 25, 2017",Scientists And Surgeons Team Up To Create Virtual Human Brain Cells," Scientists in Seattle have created three-dimensional computer reconstructions of living human brain cells by studying tissue that is usually discarded during surgery. The virtual cells, unveiled Wednesday by The Allen Institute for Brain Science, capture not only the shape and anatomy of living cells, but also the electrical signals they produce. Until now, scientists have had to rely primarily on animals to study the electrical behavior of living brain cells, says Christof Koch, chief scientist and president of the institute. ""But in order to understand what makes us who we are, we really need to study the human brain,"" Koch says. The virtual cells should also make it easier to understand how brain diseases from Alzheimer's disease to schizophrenia can affect the behavior of brain cells, he says. The computer reconstructions are the result of collaboration between Allen Institute scientists and neurosurgeons in the Seattle area. 
                Fresh samples of brain tissue being kept alive so they can be used in experiments to study individual cells.

 Fresh samples of brain tissue being kept alive so they can be used in experiments to study individual cells. These surgeons often remove diseased brain tissue from patients with brain tumors or severe epilepsy. But to get to the problem area, surgeons frequently have to remove some healthy tissue from the brain's outer layer or cortex, which contains the cells involved in thinking, memory and consciousness. ""They cut that [healthy] piece of brain out and very often it's burned as medical waste,"" Koch says. Koch thought there must be a way to learn from those bits of healthy brain. ""So we now have people inside or just outside the operating room who receive those pieces of brain, put them in a special container and then rapidly move them over here,"" he says. Each sample is ""about the size of a sugar cube,"" says Jonathan Ting, an assistant investigator at the institute. ""We're essentially keeping that tissue on life support"" until it can be sliced into thin sections and studied under a microscope, Ting says. Because the brain tissue is still alive when it reaches the lab, Ting says, ""we can clearly observe specific cells talking to one another"" via electrical signals. Source: Allen Institute Those signals, as well as data about each cell's physical structure, are captured in digital form and added to The Allen Cell Types Database, which is available to anyone with an internet connection. So far, the institute has captured electrical data from 300 living neurons taken from the brains of 36 different patients. There are 3-D reconstructions for 100 cells. Ultimately, the institute plans to add genetic information about some of the cells. The cell types database already includes a huge amount of information on mouse brains. By adding human data, researchers should be able to learn more about the differences between the brains of mice and people, Koch says. ""The basic hardware is the same,"" he says. ""But if you get close up you see there are lots and lots of small differences that translate into the fact that I will never have a dinner conversation with a mouse."" ""Ultimately we want to understand how is it that this highly organized matter gives rise to our inner life,"" Koch says. In the meantime, Allen Institute scientists are learning about some very basic differences between mouse and human brain cells. One early observation is that human brain cells can survive a lot longer in the lab. Mouse cells typically become unusable in less than 10 hours, Ting says. ""We found that this surgical tissue from people can survive up to 10 times longer."" Obtaining human brain tissue requires not only cooperation from surgeons, but from their patients, says Ed Lein, an investigator at the institute. ""It's really quite poignant to work with these tissues that participated in the thoughts and memories of an individual just an hour before,"" Lein says. Earlier this week, the Allen Institute for Brain Science received grants worth nearly $100 million from the National Institutes of Health. The five-year grants will help the Allen Institute expand its research on cell types in the brains of mice and people. Shots is the online channel for health stories from the NPR Science Desk.

npr,"October 25, 2017","Einstein's Note On Happiness, Given To Bellboy In 1922, Fetches $1.6 Million"," The year 1922 was a busy one for Albert Einstein: He completed his first paper on unified field theory, went to Paris to help normalize French-German relations and joined an intellectuals committee at the League of Nations. Shortly before heading to Asia for a lecture tour, he learned that he had won the 1921 Nobel Prize in physics. But rather than head to Stockholm for the award ceremony, he decided to keep his plans and continued to Japan. When he arrived in Tokyo, thousands greeted him at the Imperial Palace to witness his meeting the emperor and empress, according to Walter Isaacson's biography of Einstein. Nearly 2,500 paid to see his first lecture in the city, which lasted almost four hours with translation.

 Einstein arrives in the port in Kobe, Japan, in November 1922. Crowds thronged his lectures in the country, which he toured just after winning the Nobel Prize. ""No living person deserves this sort of reception,"" he told his wife, Elsa, amused at the throngs who waited outside his hotel balcony in hopes of catching a glimpse of him. ""I'm afraid we're swindlers. We'll end up in prison yet."" While staying at Tokyo's Imperial Hotel, a courier came to the door to make a delivery. The courier either refused a tip or Einstein had no small change, but Einstein wanted to give the messenger something nonetheless. So on a piece of hotel stationery, Einstein wrote in German his theory of happiness: ""A calm and modest life brings more happiness than the pursuit of success combined with constant restlessness."" On a second sheet, he wrote another message: ""Where there's a will there's a way."" He told the bellhop to save the notes — they just might be valuable in the future. And indeed they were. In an auction in Jerusalem on Tuesday, the note on happiness sold to an anonymous European bidder for $1.56 million. The second note fetched $240,000. A spokesman for the auction house, Meni Chadad, told The New York Times that it had expected the notes would garner $5,000 to $8,000. When the sale was announced, he said, the room burst into applause. ""It was an all-time record for an auction of a document in Israel, and it was just wow, wow, wow,"" Chadad said. ""I think the value can be explained by the fact that the story behind the tip is so uplifting and inspiring, and because Einstein continues to be a global rock star long after his death."" Don't have a million dollars? Einstein's papers are archived at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, where he was a founder and member of the board. More than 2,000 of his papers have been digitized for online perusal, including his handwritten theory of relativity, a diary of his 1930-31 trip to the U.S., and the manuscript for an article titled ""E=mc 2 : The Most Urgent Problem of Our Time."" There are also his notes from lectures he was giving on general relativity in Berlin and Zurich in 1918-19. In an entry from Nov. 9, 1918, the day that German emperor Kaiser Wilhelm abdicated the throne, Einstein wrote: ""[Lecture] cancelled due to revolution."" The seller of the Imperial Hotel notes is reportedly a grandson of the Japanese bellboy's brother who lives in Germany. It turns out Einstein's theory of valuation was right on the money: ""They are very, very happy,"" Chadad told the Times.

npr,"October 24, 2017","Left By Explorer's Armada, Shipwreck Yields 'Earliest Known' Marine Astrolabe"," By early 1503, most of Vasco da Gama's armada was returning home to Portugal after his second voyage to the Indian coast. The explorer, now roughly five years removed from discovering a direct sea route from Europe to India, left behind several ships to patrol (and pillage) the waters near modern-day Oman — but the winds eventually rose and smashed several of the remaining ships in raging storms. Now, more than 500 years later, the sunken ruins of one of those ships have yielded a surprising discovery: the world's ""earliest known"" marine astrolabe, according to researchers at the University of Warwick. They say the navigation tool, which sailors would use to reckon time by gauging the position of the sun and stars, dates to between 1495 and 1500. The instrument was one of more than 2,800 artifacts recovered from the Esmeralda, which has been under excavation since 2013. When Blue Water Recoveries first pulled it from the depths in 2014, David Mearns, the group's expedition leader, said he and his team suspected the 7-inch bronze disc could be an astrolabe. Moment of discovery of world's oldest Marine Astrolabe from #Esmeralda1503 shipwreck, with @mhc_gov found in 4 metres depth on 8 May 2014 pic.twitter.com/eMowyhuozV ""It was like nothing else we had seen and I immediately knew it was something very important because you could see it had these two emblems on it,"" he told the BBC. ""One I recognised immediately as a Portuguese coat of arms... and another which we later discovered was the personal emblem of Don Manuel I, the King of Portugal at the time."" But the centuries-old instrument no longer betrayed any discernible navigational markings. Mearns and his colleagues needed some help to find them.

 A scans of the astrolabe reveal not only the emblems on its face (left) but also the degree markings (right) that would have aided sailors in navigation. ""It was fantastic to apply our 3D scanning technology to such an exciting project and help with the identification of such a rare and fascinating item,"" Williams said in a statement. ""Usually we are working on engineering-related challenges, so to be able to take our expertise and transfer that to something totally different and so historically significant was a really interesting opportunity."" For Mearns, the confirmation marked an important milestone for a project that dates back nearly two decades. The shipwreck Esmeralda was discovered off the coast of Oman in 1998, and Blue Water Recoveries has been collaborating with the country's Ministry of Heritage and Culture on its excavation for roughly four years. And though it's believed astrolabes were in use long before the end of the 15th century, the BBC reports this one is only the 108th confirmed and cataloged — and the oldest one ""by several decades."" ""It's a great privilege to find something so rare, something so historically important,"" Mearns said, ""something that will be studied by the archaeological community and fills in a gap.""

npr,"October 24, 2017",Climate Change Journalist Warns: 'Mother Nature Is Playing By Different Rules Now'," This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria have shown how extreme weather can destroy towns, cities and islands. My guest Jeff Goodell is the author of a new book about what cities around the world face in a future of rising seas and increasingly intense storms. It's called ""The Water Will Come."" Goodell is a contributing editor at Rolling Stone and has covered climate change for 15 years. He's also written about fossil fuels, including the coal industry and their impact on the environment. Jeff Goodell, welcome back to FRESH AIR. So Hurricanes Irma, Harvey, Maria - all the climate people say no one event can be attributed with certainty to climate change. But what about the confluence of these three consequential hurricanes? JEFF GOODELL: Well, I mean, I think that we're seeing what's happening as we're warming up the earth's climate here. I mean, it's a very well-established fact that as the ocean temperatures heat up, that is going to increase the intensity of these storms. One of the complicated things about what's happening in our - as CO2 levels rise in our climate is that no one can predict exactly how these sort of new impacts are going to play out and what kind of consequences we're going to see. So you know, these hurricanes, these storms that we've seen this season are an indicator that, you know, we're moving into this sort of new age when the sort of old rules of how our climate works are off the table. And Mother Nature is playing by different rules now. GROSS: So just to sum up, do you think that these three hurricanes are the result of climate change? GOODELL: The hurricanes themselves are not the result of climate change. But certainly the additional intensity, the fact that we've had a number of Category 5 hurricanes is likely the result of warmer ocean temperatures and higher CO2 levels. GROSS: So your book opens with a very upsetting description of what Miami might look like by the end of the 21st century. So give it a go for us. Describe what, like - your dystopian fantasy of what Miami will look like as a result of climate change. GOODELL: Well, I mean, one of the problems with Miami is that it's very - you know, it's a very low-lying place. There's no high ground to run to. And so you know, with only, you know, 5 or 6 feet of sea level rise, which we could certainly see by the end of the century, you know, you're going to see major parts of the city inundated. You're going to see more and more flooding in residential areas. You're going to see more and more kind of pollution coming out of those flooded areas like we're seeing in Houston with Harvey - major infrastructure like the airport underwater or not functional, massive losses in real estate investment along the coast, fleeing from low-lying areas inland, which are also going to be flooded out, places like Hialeah and Sweetwater. I think the real thing that you're going to see that people don't really think about is just this sort of economic collapse and economic problems that are going to be caused by a plummet in real estate values, which are really important to the Florida economy. GROSS: What actually is happening in Miami now? You spent some time in Miami Beach, and you saw flooding just caused by high tides. Describe what you saw. GOODELL: Well, I started this book, you know, shortly after Hurricane Sandy hit New York. And you know, there was nine feet of storm surge that came into New York. And I was talking to some scientists after that, and they said, you know, think about this as a sort of, you know, experiment of what sea level rise will look like. Imagine if you had nine feet that came in and didn't go away the way it did with Sandy. So then I started thinking about that, and other scientists said, well, if you're going to really think seriously about this, you need to go to Miami. So I did. And I happened to be there on king tides, which is the time of - in the fall when the high tides are particularly high. And I started wandering around through Miami Beach on the western side of it in this sort of very wealthy neighborhood, and there was water up to my knees. I mean, there were people kayaking through the streets of Miami Beach on king tide. And it didn't take a whole lot of thinking to figure out that if you had 2 or 3 feet of sea level rise, much less 6 or 8 feet of sea level rise, this place was in big trouble. And thinking about that and thinking about what the kind of trouble it would be in and the kind of trouble that other coastal cities would be in was really the genesis of the book. GROSS: What do the people who live there do about those waters that you can kayak in? GOODELL: Well, since then - this was four years ago, and since then, they've, you know, invested $500 million in building - improving the storm drainage, improving - putting in a bunch of pumps. And so some of these areas are - you know, in short term, you know, the flooding has been better. But that's just a sort of short-term fix. And so what people are doing now is they are, you know, kind of living in a kind of denial. They are hoping that - you know, a lot of people who live in Miami Beach aren't there for - they're not thinking about being there for the next 50 years. They're thinking about being there for the next five years and how much fun they can have and, you know, how they can enjoy their retirement or their parties on the beach. And there's not a lot of long-term thinking going on in a place like Miami Beach. And so basically people's time horizon is the next five years. And will I be OK for the next five years - you know, probably. And so that's where it's at. People who think more broadly about it - and there are a number that I know - are selling and moving. GROSS: What makes Miami Beach so vulnerable? GOODELL: Well, it's interesting. Miami Beach is a barrier island not unlike the Outer Banks or Galveston, Texas, or - you know, there's many barrier islands around on the East Coast and on the Gulf Coast. So that's one thing. It's low-lying. Its elevation is 4, 5, 6 feet at max. But the real problem with Miami that makes it different than a lot of other places is that it's built on this sort of porous limestone. The particular kind of limestone it's on is full of holes. And so what that means is that you can't build sea walls in the traditional sense around Miami Beach. In New York and in Boston and of course in the Netherlands, there's lots of sea walls, and they can be an effective, if problematic, way of keeping water back for a while. But in Miami, that's not really possible because of this porous limestone, which means the seawater can just go right underneath a wall and just pop up on the other side. And this has complications not just for kind of protection of the place but also because as that seawater rises and begins to seep underneath, it gets into the freshwater drinking aquifer, which is very shallow in Miami. And so there's going to be impact. There's already problems with the salinization of drinking water. So there's going to be a problem with drinking water in the very near term also. GROSS: What's Governor Rick Scott's position - the Florida governor - on climate change? GOODELL: Rick Scott is, you know, a pioneering climate denier. Rick Scott has, you know, unofficially kind of prohibited government employees from using the phrase climate change in any kind of government communication. I mean, he's this sort of prototype for what we're seeing in the Trump administration with EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt and others who are basically just trying to deny that this is a problem. And it's a particular disservice in Florida because Florida is, you know, so obviously at risk. It's not like he's the governor of Oklahoma or something where, you know, sea level rise is not going to be a problem. In Florida, it's a direct risk not only to people's lives with flooding but also just to the economic future of the state. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Jeff Goodell. He's a contributing editor at Rolling Stone magazine and author of the new book ""The Water Will Come: Rising Seas, Sinking Cities, And The Remaking Of The Civilized World."" He's been covering climate change for about 15 years. We're going to take a short break, and then we'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF LOOP 2.4.3'S ""ZODIAC DUST"") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Jeff Goodell. He's a contributing editor at Rolling Stone and the author of the new book ""The Water Will Come: Rising Seas, Sinking Cities, And The Remaking Of The Civilized World."" And he's been writing about climate change for 15 years. So let's talk about the ice sheets. Many of them are melting, and that's affecting sea levels, causing them to rise. And that's affecting climate change and ocean levels. So let's start with the ice sheets. You say that there's much more melting in the Arctic than in Antarctica. Why is that? GOODELL: Well, a lot of the heat from the warming of the Earth is sort of concentrating itself up in the north in the Arctic right now, and that's the, you know, fastest melting place on the planet right now. And when we think about sea level rise, you know, there's a number of factors - the thermal expansion of the ocean, the melting of glaciers on land, you know, land-based glaciers around the world - but it's really - when it comes down to it, it's really all about Greenland and Antarctica. Those are the only two sort of big ice cubes on the planet that if they - when they go, that's big trouble. So what we've seen mostly right now is a lot of surface melting up in Greenland, and that's been a big cause for concern. We've seen - in 2012 there was a record ice melt up there. And, you know, we're seeing acceleration of the glaciers in Greenland. But ice physics is very complex and, you know, scientists up until recently sort of had this idea that they could calculate how fast a big ice sheet like Greenland can melt and have a good idea of what sea level rise rates might be like in the future. But recently, a lot of attention is being focused in West Antarctica, especially this couple of glaciers there called Thwaites and Pine Island Glacier where the real problem is that you have a warming ocean - the ocean absorbs a lot of the heat of - as the atmosphere warms. And that warming ocean is getting underneath the ice sheets there, and that can cause big problems because you have melting from below. And one of the things that scientists are figuring out is that you can calculate to a pretty good degree how fast an ice sheet will melt, but calculating how fast it can collapse is a whole a different thing. And some of the ice sheets in West Antarctica are a mile or two high. And if the water gets underneath them and they start to collapse, that could mean very rapid sea level rise. GROSS: Yeah, why is a collapse so catastrophic? GOODELL: Well, because you have an ice sheet that's, you know, a mile or two high. Imagine, you know, everyone - a lot of people have seen pictures of El Capitan. Imagine something like that or twice as high as that of sheer ice melting from below. And the physics of ice structure tells us that a cliff like that of ice can't stand on its own. So it will collapse, and as it collapses, it falls into the sea, and as it falls into the sea, sea levels rise. And so the risks of this are a really new idea that are only in the last three or four or five years are scientists really beginning to understand. And that's why when you talk to the best ice scientists in the world you hear a rising alarm in their voice about what we might potentially be facing. GROSS: You've been to Greenland, and you say you actually stood on land that you might have been among the first people to stand on because it wasn't - it was ice before. GOODELL: Yeah, it was a very surreal experience. I was there with a scientist named Jason Box, and we were flying a helicopter over the Jakobshavn Glacier, which is the fastest-moving glacier in the world. And he spotted this bare spot of ice, and he said, we have to land there, we have to land there. So we brought the helicopter down, and we jumped out and, you know, he shouted out new climate land. You know, this is - this patch of Earth has never been - you know, no human has stood here before and it hasn't been seen - you know, it hasn't been uncovered in tens of thousands of years. It was very profound because standing there and being on that bare patch of ground and seeing these enormous glaciers all around me, I had just been in Miami Beach, I mean, a few weeks before. And you really connected, you know, I really connected in a visceral way, you know, what was happening in this faraway, distant place on this bare piece of ground that was being uncovered where I could actually see the ice going away fast with the rising waters in Miami Beach that I had seen and been wading through, you know, a few weeks earlier. And so this sort of connectedness of these places, which is so hard for most of us, including myself, to really grasp, I really felt in a very powerful way at that moment. GROSS: I've seen film images of some of the ice and snow - I guess it's mostly ice - in the Arctic darkened by soot. Like, why is there soot there? GOODELL: That's an interesting question. That's one of the things that I was up there to look at with the scientist who I traveled up there with, Jason Box, is, you know, we talked about wildfires earlier. As the wildfires in California and other - in Russia and in China and other places burn, that soot gets picked up and carried up into the circulatory patterns in the atmosphere and gets dropped places. And one of the places a lot of it gets dropped is in Greenland and in the Arctic. And it's really remarkable that even a small amount of darkening of snow has a big impact on how fast it will melt. It's the same reason why you wear a light-colored shirt on a hot day and you feel a lot hotter if you're wearing a black shirt. It absorbs the heat. And in Greenland, where you have these vast ice sheets, if you get even a modest amount of soot on those ice sheets, both from wildfires or from industrial pollution like coal plants, it can really speed up the melting. And one of the things that's happening as scientists think harder and harder about what's happening on the ice sheets is they're understanding that there's a lot of new factors that they didn't consider before. Like, you know, 10 years ago, not very many scientists were really thinking about the impact that darker soot would have on the melt rate of the ice sheets in Greenland. But now they know that it's a significant factor. And there's a lot of other factors that they think they have not considered very well that - including the friction on the bottom of the glaciers and the friction on the sides of the canyons as the glaciers move through them, the warming of the ocean on the bottom of the glaciers. There's just - it's a - you would think it's a very sort of simple idea of trying to calculate melt rate of ice, but it's in fact incredibly complex. GROSS: Let's look at Alaska. Alaska's in a kind of interesting situation in that it's very dependent on fossil fuel. It raises a lot of money from fossil fuel. And at the same time, temperatures are rising in Alaska because of the whole phenomenon that we've been talking about - about how, you know, the Arctic is warming and ice is melting. So what are political leaders in Alaska saying about climate change and the impact it's having on the state and the connection of that to fossil fuels? GOODELL: Well, they're not saying much. I'm actually just back from Alaska. I was just there for a few days. I just got back yesterday. So I've - and I talked to a number of politicians there, and, you know, the basic problem in Alaska is that, you know, their economy is dependent upon fossil fuels. Eighty percent or so of the revenues of the state come from oil and gas. And so there's no real way that the state can continue to function by, you know, reducing the drilling and pumping of oil and gas. It's - they're just completely dependent upon it. So there is no conversation, basically, about, you know, reducing that. And in fact, they're talking about expanding it, looking into offshore drilling. Right now, Congress is, you know, moving towards opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling, and nobody there that I talked to in the sort of political establishment is anything but, you know, sort of embracing that. What is beginning to happen, though, is they are beginning to realize that, you know, no matter what they do, they're going to be feeling impacts. They are feeling impacts. When I was there with President Obama in 2015, we visited the villages on the - in the Arctic Circle that are already in trouble because of erosion from sea level rise. They're just going to have to relocate many coastal villages because of - they're just at risk now because the seas are higher and the storm surges are bigger. So they're facing hundreds of millions of dollars in helping people adapt there. So they're beginning to have this, like, OK-so-how-are-we-going-to-adapt conversation. What are we going to do about this? And they're beginning to think more about the future in diversifying their economy and trying to encourage kind of what they call this, you know, sort of transition from an oil economy to a salmon economy. That's a big issue. But basically, it - they're in a really tough spot because they are really, you know, dependent upon the very fossil fuels that're doing them in. And it's a very vicious circle to be caught in. GROSS: Do you think political leaders are acknowledging, OK, we're dependent on fossil fuels, but we acknowledge, at the same time, that fossil fuels are helping to lead to climate change, which is having an altering effect on the geography, the landscape, the life of Alaska? GOODELL: Yeah. I mean, I don't think that they're - the political leaders that I've talked to up there - it's very hard to be a denier there in the sort of classic way of say, you know, Florida Governor Rick Scott or EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt because it's just all around. And the permafrost is melting. It's just, you know, obvious there. But the question is, what can you do about it? And it's a really - for - if you're, you know, the governor or a senator from Alaska - and I'm not giving them a get-out-of-jail-free card, but, you know, for any politician, you know, keeping the economy going is the No. 1 job. And in Alaska, keeping the economy going for the moment means, you know, oil and gas drilling. And that's just the fact, and that's the way it's going to be in the near term. The question is, how quickly can they diversify away from that? How quickly can they begin to build another, a new kind of economy based on clean energy? I mean, there's a lot of engineering ability in Alaska. I mean, look at the pipelines they've built. I mean, this is the headquarters of sort of big, you know, brilliant engineering. And the idea of beginning to, you know, apply some of that to adaptation, to diversifying, to building new kinds of clean energy, you know, is really appealing. And I was, you know, trying to make the pitch to them up there that they can be a real leader in showing how to adapt to these massive changes that're coming and how to change from a fossil-fuel-dependent economy to something else. I mean, West Virginia's a classic example of a state that never did make that turn and has been sort of beholden to coal for, you know, 150 years, and it's just been, you know, devastating for the economy of that state. GROSS: My guest is Jeff Goodell. His new book is called ""The Water Will Come."" After we take a short break, he'll describe how climate change is affecting the military, and we'll talk about climate deniers in the Trump administration, including the head of the EPA, Scott Pruitt. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF STEFON HARRIS AND BLACKOUT'S ""UNTIL"") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross back with Jeff Goodell, the author of a new book about cities around the world that are being threatened by extreme weather caused by climate change. It's called ""The Water Will Come: Rising Seas, Sinking Cities, And The Remaking Of The Civilized World."" He's a contributing editor at Rolling Stone and has covered climate change for 15 years. Although your book is largely about how climate change is affecting cities, you also write about how it's affecting the military because there's a lot of military bases at risk because of flooding. You want to describe that a little bit? GOODELL: Oh, there certainly are. I mean, the military is really an interesting piece of this whole conversation. I spent a - I made several visits to the naval station in Norfolk, which is the largest naval station in the world, home to six aircraft carriers, played a central role in, you know, the military operations in Afghanistan and the Middle East. And about 75,000 sailors and civilians work there. It's just this giant complex. And, you know, I was there at high tide and, you know, it was flooding. I mean, the military barracks, the roads on the base were flooding. The - you know, downtown Norfolk had several feet under water. I mean, it's a huge problem for a base like Norfolk, which is - you know, the idea of relocating it - besides the fact that it's, you know, politically kind of toxic to even have that discussion and would be economically devastating for the region, it's just - the logistics of it are mind-boggling. But what's really striking is that the military - you know, not everyone - but, by and large, the military gets it because as one commander said to me, you know, our job is to deal with the world as it is, not as we would like it to be. So they get sea level rise. They get climate change. They understand this. But, you know, because of the way our political structure works and because of Congress, they can't really talk about it openly. So at Norfolk, for example, they had built several new - these enormous piers that cost millions of dollars. And they, you know, built them, you know, 4, 5, 6 feet higher than the old piers. And I said to the commander, well, did you do this for sea level rise? And he basically said, yes, but we didn't say that because if we would have said that, then we wouldn't have got funding from Congress. They would have zeroed it out because they, you know, don't want to talk about climate change in any way. So the military's in this - stuck in this position of, like, having to deal with this thing called climate change - which is, you know, changing sea level rises, you know, destabilizing populations, doing - having all kinds of impacts on their operations with water supplies and stuff - but not being able to talk about it because Congress won't - you know, won't fund anything that has to do with that. GROSS: So the military is not only concerned about direct damage to military bases caused by climate change. It's also worried about the possible national security consequences of climate change. What are some of the consequences the military is envisioning in terms of national security? GOODELL: What the military is really concerned about is, you know, the sort of increasing political destabilization of volatile places in the world. Secretary Kerry a few years ago called climate change a weapon of mass destruction. And by that he meant that, you know, increasing hurricanes like we're seeing, droughts which caused political instability in places like Syria, which we've already seen. And the National Academy of Sciences did a study on the causes of the uprising in Syria, and they determined that the drought there had a catalytic effect on that. So in the biggest sense, what they're concerned about is just the increasing destabilization of the world. And as we know right now, we can see the problems of refugees, of people moving around, all of the political problems that that is causing. And when you add climate change to that, when you add droughts and floods and destruction of places like Puerto Rico and where those millions of people who live there are going to go - are they going to rebuild their lives there? Or are they going to move to Florida or somewhere else? And if they do, what will the impacts of that be? That's in the broadest sense what they're concerned about. They're concerned about what is essentially the operating system of the planet kind of going a little haywire and what the implications of that will be. GROSS: You've - in writing about climate change, you've also been investigating climate deniers, the climate denial movement. There are a lot of people who deny that climate change is a reality who are in the Trump administration now. Would you just do a roll call of some of the climate deniers in the administration? GOODELL: We could just do a roll call of the entire administration. I'm not sure there's anyone in the administration that I'm aware of who would acknowledge climate change. I mean, you know, it starts with the president himself, who famously called climate change a kind of Chinese hoax and has done nothing to kind of dispel that kind of absurd characterization despite being given many opportunities to. EPA administrator Scott Pruitt, who was essentially brought in to run the EPA explicitly to roll back some of the plans like the Clean Power Plan and other initiatives that the Obama administration did to help reduce emissions and kind of meet the Paris climate deal goals - you know, virtually the head of every agency, especially, you know, in the Interior, Department of Energy. I mean, it's just a kind of empire of climate denial that is now running Washington, D.C. GROSS: What do you attribute that to? GOODELL: Money. You know, I think it's pretty clear that, you know, the debate in America politically is skewered by enormous contributions from oil and gas industry, from, you know, the Koch Industries - the Koch brothers. You know, they've done a very good job of planting doubt about this and making it clear that, you know, this for them is a kind of cultural - a kind of litmus test. If you want our support, you know, you need to get on board with this. And one of the hard things about the climate change sort of debate in America now is that it's become this kind of cultural litmus test. It's like abortion or something like that. It's like - it's very difficult to have a kind of reasoned discussion about it anymore because it's one of those things that you're sort of either for or against. And it's very disheartening. GROSS: What are some of the things you fear will be undone? Trump is - President Trump is pulling the U.S. out of the Paris climate accord. What are some of the other climate change policies and regulations that you see being undone? GOODELL: Well, part of it is the, you know, rollback of the Clean Power Plan and things like that that were designed to sort of accelerate the advancement of clean energy. And that's really important. But, you know, I also think that there's a lot of investment in clean energy right now. And a lot of states, like California and Washington and New York and others, are really pushing forward on this. And it's very clear to everyone around the world - except, you know, the climate deniers in the center of the Trump administration, and I don't even think they actually believe it - that the economic future not only of the United States, but of the kind of global economy is in this clean energy revolution. We're not going back to coal. We're not going back to oil and gas. We may use them for a little bit longer. But the future is in solar and wind and other renewables. So there's the slowing down of that - is one issue. But, you know, and then there's another issue of the sort of lack of funding and thinking about any kind of adaptation for this. We need to think about things like sea level rise. I mean, no matter how fast we cut carbon emissions - even if everybody sells their SUVs and rides skateboards to work tomorrow, we're still going to have a lot of sea level rise. And places need to start thinking about that. We need to start thinking in a kind of bigger picture about this - not just about building sea walls, but about moving people who are in high-risk areas out of those areas and doing things like relocating major infrastructure like airports and things like that. I mean, this is - those kinds of things take a long time to plan and think about. And we need to start doing that now. And then the final thing that concerns me about what's happening is just this whole debasement of science, just the whole question of, like - you know, that we don't make decisions about our future and about our future risk based on good science. And I think that is really what is the - when you get down to it the most disturbing and frankly frightening thing about what's happening in the Trump administration. It's just the - you know, the complete politicalization of science. And not just about climate change, but we're seeing it about, you know, air pollution, toxic chemicals, all kinds of things. And once you throw science out, that's a very scary world. GROSS: Scott Pruitt, the head of the EPA under President Trump, you said that he is, among other things, trying to destroy the legal foundation for greenhouse gas regulations of any kind. How is he trying to do that? GOODELL: Well, I think - I mean, I don't think it's too much to say that that was why he was given the job. I mean, as the attorney general in Oklahoma, he, you know, led the assault on Obama's Clean Power Plan. And, you know, he - that is the state where he - a very big oil and gas state and they do not like this because it hurts the oil and gas industry, they believe. And so they want to get rid of that. So Pruitt is right now in the process of trying to rollback this - Obama's Clean Power Plan, which reduced emissions from coal plants, existing coal plants around the country. But, you know, it's not clear that he's really going to be successful in the long term on this because, you know, there's a Supreme Court decision that basically found that, you know, CO2 is an endangerment to human welfare and that as a - and is a pollutant and that as a pollutant, the EPA is required to regulate it. So he's got to come up with some kind of a plan to replace the Clean Power Plan, and it's not clear exactly what that will be. But, you know, it will be some sort of pale shadow of what we have now. GROSS: Well, let's take a short break, and then we'll talk some more. If you're just joining us, my guest is Jeff Goodell. He's the author of the new book ""The Water Will Come: Rising Seas, Sinking Cities, And The Remaking Of The Civilized World."" He's been writing about climate change for 15 years. We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF YO LA TENGO'S ""HOW SOME JELLYFISH ARE BORN"") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR, and if you're just joining us, my guest is Jeff Goodell who has been reporting on climate change for 15 years. His new book is called ""The Water Will Come: Rising Seas, Sinking Cities, And The Remaking Of The Civilized World."" Something funny in the book because on the whole it's not a very funny book. (LAUGHTER) GROSS: But something I thought was kind of funny is when you're in the Arctic looking at melting ice there. You're staying at a hotel, and you say it's the hotel that Al Gore stays at when he's in the Arctic (laughter). I thought that was hilarious. Did - do you find yourself following some of the same, like, being in the same - some of the same places he's been in looking at climate change? GOODELL: Certainly not knowingly, but, you know - and I have lots of respect for Al. It wouldn't bother me if I did, but that particular hotel in the Arctic is sort of, you know, there's - everyone goes to this one place to see this famous glacier called the Jakobshavn. And, you know, there's a lot of sort of, you know, climate change tourism that's happening now. And when I first went to Greenland, I was struck by all the sort of middle-aged people in North Face jackets who were wandering around, and I was like, well, what are all these people doing here? And it's like they all come to see the ice sheets before they melt or to watch them melt. And this one hotel is particularly nice. It's, you know, there's not like - there's only, like, two hotels in the town, so it's not like there's a huge selection. But you have an incredible view of the bay and the icebergs going out, and you can drink - sit there and, you know, have your after-dinners whiskey and watch the icebergs and think about the end of the world. GROSS: (Laughter) That sounds so pleasant (laughter). GOODELL: It's really nice. GROSS: A happy hour (laughter). GOODELL: Yeah, exactly. GROSS: Or unhappy hour. So some of the people who are trying to plan for climate change are trying to build floating islands, and one of the people behind this is Peter Thiel, who was the founder of PayPal. He's - is or was on the board of Facebook, and I think now he's a venture capitalist. Am I right about that? GOODELL: Mhmm (ph). GROSS: So he's one of the people behind The Seasteading Institute, which I think they have two goals. One is to have, like, floating islands that will protect them against the rising ocean problem because they'll be rising with the ocean. But the other is to kind of get away from government regulations and be at a part in the ocean where they're not subjected to any kind of laws and restrictions pertaining to any particular government. So from what you know about the science of rising oceans, will these kind of floating islands be protected because they're floating? GOODELL: Well, I think that floating islands are a really interesting idea. And in my - when I was reporting my book, I went to places like Lagos in Nigeria where I visited these water slums that are, you know, hundreds of thousands of people living in, you know, stilts, you know, essentially tents on stilts in the water. And yeah, you talk to them about sea level rise, and they're like, well, no problem. You know, we'll just put on stilts a little bit higher, and, you know, they're very adaptable. And I think that, you know, for all the sort of darkness about sea level rise and what the impacts it will have on places like Miami, which are certainly real and it will cause huge amounts of economic devastation and, you know, put a lot of people at risk, there's also this sort of other side of it, which is this sort of creative new ways of living. And people love living by the water. I love being by the water, you know? And everybody does, and - you know? And so the idea of figuring out a way to live on a floating island, you know, I think is - might be quite wonderful. And it - and one way to think about this is - the sort of dawn of a kind of new age of living with water. I mean, you go to a city like Venice, and you're there two seconds, and you realize, oh, my God, this is fabulous, you know? I mean, Venice has other problems. But this idea of, can we live with and - you know, in water - of course we can. We just haven't had a reason to do that until now. GROSS: And a lot of what we do have might be destroyed along the way before we find an alternative. GOODELL: Oh, absolutely, absolutely. I mean, you know, there's - you know, the problem, basically, with sea level rise is the built infrastructure, that we've built billions of dollars' worth of real estate in roads, and airports, and railroad tracks and everything, you know, very close to the water with this notion in the kind of classic human way that, you know, what we see is the way it will always be. We never thought, oh, well, the Earth has changed a lot before, maybe the Earth will change again. Seas will come up, go down. You know, maybe this is not a fixed boundary. And so all this stuff that's built on the fixed boundary is doomed. And - but that doesn't mean that, you know, we humans are doomed. It means that we may figure out really cool, new ways of thinking about this and being adaptable. I mean, primitive cultures were really good at living on the coast because they didn't have, you know, multibillion-dollar condos there - they - you know, buildings there. They had flexible infrastructure that could move around, and there's no reason we can't do that again. GROSS: Is there an example of something you've seen in a city that's prone to flooding because of climate change that has come up with a good adaptation to deal with it? GOODELL: Well, yeah, there's a lot of really interesting things happening. I mean, so - you know, simple things like in Rotterdam and other places in Europe - but the one I saw was in Rotterdam - are these sort of water squares. They're big sort of public squares that are - that if you look at them on a normal day, they just look like a kind of sunken concrete - you know, like a big pool, except sort of nicely done, with places to sit and everything. But they're designed so that when there's big flooding, the water all goes in there, and it kind of drains the water from all the neighborhood nearby. It's all designed to run that way, and then it drains out. So it's a way of, like, dealing with the water in that way. You know, in Lagos, I saw a floating kind of community center that was built very - in a very simple way by a Dutch architect, essentially using plastic oil drums, you know, lashed together, and then, you know, this kind of elegant structure on top of it - a two-story structure that was hugely popular and became the sort of center of this community - that was, you know, one example of it. In the Netherlands, I went to a place where there was flooding problems with a river. And so instead of building sea walls or river walls along the river, they just moved an entire town next - that was having problems with flooding and allowed the river to sort of run out onto this plane where the town had been. So they essentially relocated a bunch of people in order to give the river room to expand. And I think that that's the sort of trend that I'm seeing - is this idea that, you know, as one scientist said to me, you know, you never want to fight a war with water because water will always win. And people are beginning to get that and to stop trying to block it off and build walls but live with it in various ways. GROSS: Well, Jeff Goodell, thank you so much for talking with us. GOODELL: Thank you for having me, Terry. GROSS: Jeff Goodell is the author of the new book ""The Water Will Come: Rising Seas, Sinking Cities, And The Remaking Of The Civilized World."" After we take a short break, self-identified feminist and Muslim comic Zahra Noorbakhsh will tell us how hate crimes against Muslims have affected her fear level. This is FRESH AIR.

npr,"October 29, 2017",Bats And Tequila: A Once Boo-tiful Relationship Cursed By Growing Demands," At a Halloween happy hour recently in Washington, D.C., a small crowd gathered to celebrate the relationship between bats and spirits. Not spooky spirits. Instead, think tequila and mescal. ""We're here at a bar tonight to talk about [bats], because they are intimately tied to agave,"" announced Mike Daulton, the executive director of Bat Conservation International, a nonprofit devoted to the well-being of bats. You can't have tequila without agave, the spiky desert plant used as its base. And it's hard to have agave without bats — because a few species of these winged creatures are the plant's primary pollinators. Agave co-evolved with bats over thousands of years. As a result, it's one of the very few plants that pollinates at night. Daulton says industrial agave farming adversely affects both plants and bats. ""The tequila industry has seen a 60 percent growth over the past 10 years,"" he says. ""At the super-premium level, where you're spending $30 a bottle or more, it's more like 400 percent growth. And that means you have to grow a lot of agave."" The problem, adds Micaela Jemison, also of Bat Conservation International, is that commercial production involves cutting agave stalks before they reproduce. That means no tasty pollen for hungry bats. And instead of plants that reproduce through bats spreading pollen from stem to stem, major tequila companies use cloned agave. ""They are not naturally pollinated,"" Jemison says. Growing genetically identical plants is easy and cheap for big companies, but cloned agave is vulnerable to fungus or disease that could wipe out entire crops. Bats can solve this problem by creating genetic diversity. Instead, their ecosystem has been disrupted. Fewer agave plants are allowed to flower and growers use powerful agrochemicals that can hurt the three kind of bats that feed on agave. Two of these bats are listed as endangered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service: the Mexican long-nosed bat and the lesser long-nosed bat. The third, the Mexican long-tongued bat, is listed as a species of concern. Jemison says these bats need stretchy, Gene Simmons-esque tongues while they hover over fertile agave stems stuffed with pollen. ""[They] use their long tongues to actually dig into the flower and get out that really awesome nectar for them to eat,"" she says. ""So they literally get their heads covered in this pollen. And as they're going from agave plant to agave plant, they're pollinating them at the same time."" This happy hour is the perfect place to overhear enthusiastic cocktail chatter about bats. Bats have belly buttons. They're the second largest group of mammals in the world. The tube-lipped nectar bat has the longest tongue of any animal relative to its size in the world. Restaurateur Joaquin Meza says as a boy growing up in Mexico, he was afraid of bats. ""You know, I saw a bat and I wanted to run away,"" he says. ""Now I understand the work they do. Like bees."" Meza is part of the Tequila Interchange Project, a coalition of bartenders, scientists, industry consultants and plain old tequila lovers who want to make producing it more sustainable. As part of its mission, the group promotes bat-friendly brands of tequila and mescal that allow a portion of agave plants in their farms to flower — and feed the flying creatures who come trick-or-treating for their pollen after dark. With a pinch of skepticism and a dash of fun, The Salt covers food news from the farm to the plate and beyond.

npr,"October 27, 2017",Who Says You Can't Train A Cat? A Book Of Tips For Feline-Human Harmony," This is FRESH AIR. I'm David Bianculli, editor of the website TV Worth Watching, sitting in for Terry Gross. The common wisdom about pets is that you can train a dog, but you can't train a cat. Today's guest says you can train a cat, but it takes an understanding of how cats learn. Sarah Ellis is the co-author with John Bradshaw of the book, ""The Trainable Cat,"" which is now out in paperback. Among the things she's trained her cats to do is come when she calls, voluntarily walk into the cat carrier to go to the vet, take medicine and be friendly to her dog and her baby. Ellis is a feline behavior specialist at the British charity group International Cat Care, which collaborates with organizations around the world involved with cat welfare. She's also a visiting fellow at the University of Lincoln in England. Terry spoke with her last year. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST) TERRY GROSS, HOST:  Sarah Ellis, welcome to FRESH AIR. Why are cats more difficult to train than dogs, and do you even agree with the premise that cats are more difficult to train than dogs? SARAH ELLIS: I think, yes, they can be more difficult, but it's all about having a little bit more patience and a little bit more understanding of what the cat is in terms of its behavior and where it's come from. And then once owners have that understanding, the patience comes much more naturally, and then they can see that training is possible. GROSS: But as you point out, you can't train cats the same way that you train dogs. I mean, it's similar but different because cats respond to different things and they have different sensory ways of intaking information. One of the things you point out is that dogs are creatures of habit, cats are creatures of place. What does that mean? ELLIS: OK, so, yeah, I think the fundamental difference between dogs and cats and how it influences the way that they perceive training is that dogs are innately very, very sociable. They have evolved from a social animal, the wolf, and they are incredibly sociable not just to their own species but to humans. The cat, however, has evolved from a solitary ancestor, the North African wildcat, and that process of domestication has also been much, much shorter, if you like. And therefore, the cat hasn't had the chance to develop these social tendencies that the dog already has. So because of that, the cat's a little bit more on the back foot or the back paw, if you like. They're less likely to understand our - the cues that we may give, for example, things like pointing. They're less likely to naturally attune to us. So they're much less likely to look at our faces, to be able to read our expressions. GROSS: When you say cats are creatures of place, not of habit, what do you mean by that? ELLIS: OK, so going back to this idea that dogs are really sociable and cats less so - because of that, the primary attachment for a dog is generally its owner. By an attachment bond, think of, like, a mother and their child. It's that bond being around - a child to be around its mother creates a feeling of safety and security. And when you go to a new place as a child, as long as your mother or your parent is there, you still feel a sense of safety, and that's the same for a dog. So for when a dog goes to the vet's with its owner, the dog still feels relatively safe and secure and could cope with the environment because its owner's there, that security blanket. For the cats, that security does not necessarily come from a person or another animal. It comes from a physical place. Cats are very, very territorial animals, and they create safety by getting to know a physical place very well and by marking that place and impregnating it with their own scent. So when we take the cat out of that physical environment, we've taken away their safety or their security, and that's why they don't cope nearly as well in novel environments. GROSS: And what are the implications of that for training a cat? ELLIS: Well, the first thing is many of the things that we want to train a cat involve novel places. So you mentioned already going to the vet's, the boarding cattery, moving house, et cetera. And one of the ways that we tend to move cats is we put them in a cat carrier. And so those things are intrinsically stressful for a cat because they're taking them away from their place of safety and security. So the first thing we would want to teach a cat - I think every cat should be taught this as a life skill - is that the cat carrier can become a portable place of safety and security. It is a safe, secure place and is part of the cat's normal territory. And now we have a portable item of security, just like for the dog, its owner, for the cat, its cat carrier. And that's the foundation, I think, for training in terms of novelty. GROSS: So with a cat carrier, to teach the cat that it's a safe place and it's safe to be there when you're taking the cat to a new location, whether it's the airport or the vet, do you keep your carrier out all the time so that it's a very familiar part of the cat's environment, as if it were a piece of furniture in the house? ELLIS: Yeah, absolutely. That's what we would really like to encourage cat owners to do. Currently, what most cat owners do is they keep the cat carrier hidden in a closet or in the basement. And the day that the cat has to go to the vet's, they tend to bring it out. And what that does for the cat is it becomes a very predictive signal that something unpleasant is about to come because they've already made this association between the cat carrier and the travel or the vet's. Instead, as you say, if we keep the cat carrier out all the time, it becomes a regular part of the furniture within their territory. They get the opportunity to facial mark it and to sleep in it and to eat in it, so to have positive experiences within it and also to impregnate their own scent onto it, which is how they feel safe and secure. And therefore it's already a part of their home, so we're taking that place with them when we take them somewhere new. I think the main reason, at the moment, that owners don't do that is that cat carriers don't look particularly pleasant and people don't like the look of them out in their homes. And I think really for - to improve that, we really need to think about nicer, cleaner designs of cat carrier that not only function as a cat carrier but that owners would be happy to leave out in their homes at all time. GROSS: Cats live in the present, and you say any reward or punishment that you use for a cat - and, by the way, you recommend against punishment, and we'll get to that a little bit later - but any reward or punishment should happen immediately after the action. So what kind of problem sets in if you wait a couple of minutes? ELLIS: If you wait a couple of minutes, what you'll, in effect, be rewarding is the behavior that's happening in those couple of minutes later. So cats really, really are a little bit unforgiving, if you like - as are many other animals - in terms of if you are not good with your timing of your training. And by timing, I mean the delivery of the reward because they need to have the two things happening very, very close in time to know that the association is between those two things. And that's classical conditioning. That's not necessarily unique for the cat. That's the same with any animal. So we need to have a message to tell them that was exactly it, right now, right there, what you're doing. If we cannot give the reward at that exact time, and usually the reward is food, we can use other things to pinpoint or reward or mark that behavior that allows the cat to know that food is going to come two minutes later. But the only way you can do that is, first of all, to create an association between whatever your marker behavior is and your reward. So if I give you an example, quite often - let's say we were teaching a cat to go through a cat flap. I couldn't give him the food at the moment that he's going through the cat flap. GROSS: A cat flap is like a cat door, one of those little cat doors. ELLIS: Yeah, a cat door. The behavior that we would want to reward, going through the cat door or jumping down, we cannot give food at that exact moment in time because we might not physically be able to get the food to the other side of the cat door or to the cat the minute its - the second its feet lands on the floor. So we can use something that we call a marker. And in this case, very often with cats, I just use a word, and that word's often just good. But what you have to do before that is teach the cat that the word good predicts that the real reward, the food, is going to come. And you do that just simply by pairing those two things, presenting the word good, so saying it and then giving food. And doing that time again. And then you know the cat has learned the association when you just say the word, good, and the cat orientates towards you. It might meow at you. It shows you all the behaviors that it normally shows you that are indicative that it knows food is on its way. Then you've got a tool that will allow you to buy those extra few seconds, but it's not going to be a few minutes. It's only going to be a few seconds. GROSS: OK, so when you're teaching a cat to respond to a word like good, what exactly is the cat hearing? Do you have any idea? And I have this habit - I don't know if it's annoying to my cat or what, but, I sometimes talk to my cat in a falsetto (imitating high voice) like this. (LAUGHTER) GROSS: I don't know where that comes from, but I don't know, like, is it the rhythm of the word? Is it the, you know, like - our cat's name is Rowdy (ph), and I'll call him like, Rowdy. And, you know, so is he hearing the melody of that sound or, like - what's the best way to talk to a cat? ELLIS: Cats generally cope well with quiet voices. They don't like very loud voices. That can be frightening for them. And they do tend to like female voices a lot because they attune very well to high pitch. Their auditory system is very much designed to hear high-pitch sounds because prey make very, very high-pitch sounds and, therefore, they do tend to orientate towards high sounds better. So I don't think it's a problem at all if owners are speaking to their cats in the more sort of baby-voice-type language. GROSS: You recommend against punishment. You're all for reward. Why is punishment bad? And we're not talking about, you know, beating the cat, but just, like, a negative response like squirting the cat with water or shaking noisy keys at it. ELLIS: Yeah, the reason that we don't advocate punishment at all is because it can be really, really damaging to the relationship of the cat with the human. If you get your timing wrong, you may be punishing a very different behavior to what you think you're punishing, and that can be quite disastrous. And, secondly, if you're delivering that punishment - so you are holding a water sprayer, or you are throwing something at the cat, or you are physically, you know, smacking its back end off the kitchen counter, whatever it is, the cat will associate that punishment with you and may not associate it with the actual act of what it's doing because you're very salient in that environment, at that time, and you are the one delivering the punishment. And so all you're doing then is teaching your cat that you are not a very good person to be around, that you deliver quite unpleasant consequences and, therefore, the cat will start to avoid you rather than stopping to do that behavior. GROSS: So how do you teach a cat not to do something, to stop doing something? ELLIS: So it very much depends on the behavior. But what we would do is try and teach on incompatible behavior. So we would teach the cat to do something else instead that meant they couldn't do the behavior that was undesired. And we would make a different behavior very, very rewarding, so they were very, very motivated to do it. We would also find out what the particular behavior was that they were doing that was undesirable and why they were motivated to do that behavior. And we have to think about is it a behavior that they actually need to do for their own welfare? So, for example, let's say, scratching, and they're scratching the furniture as opposed to scratching on their scratch post. We couldn't just stop that behavior completely because it's a natural behavior for cats, and it's something that they should be allowed to do, and we should accept that they do as part of being a cat. So, therefore, we think we would want to train the cat to redirect that behavior onto something that we would consider much more appropriate, rather than stop it completely. GROSS: Like a scratching post? ELLIS: Like a scratching post, exactly. GROSS: My experience is cats love the furniture and the scratching post. ELLIS: (Laughter). GROSS: You're just adding more joy in their lives, but you're not discouraging them from scratching the things you don't want them to scratch. ELLIS: And, I think, for cats that are housed indoor only, they will often scratch in multiple places within the home because they will often scratch at multiple places within their territory, at the boundary of their territories. So for cats that are allowed outdoor access, that's often outdoors. But for cats that don't have outdoor access, those multiple points are often within the home. So it's a case of educating owners that, actually, one scratch post is often not enough. Most of us just don't have one chair in our house. We have several chairs, and we'll sit in different ones and, therefore, we need to think about being providing extra resources for our cats - more than one scratch post. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Sarah Ellis. She's a cat behavior specialist and co-author of the new book, ""The Trainable Cat."" Let's take a short break, and then we'll talk some more. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF DICK HYMAN AND IVAN DAVIS AND MAURICE PERESS'S ""KITTEN ON THE KEYS"") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR, and if you're just joining us, my guest is Sarah Ellis. She's a cat behavior specialist and her new book, ""The Trainable Cat"" is all about how to train cats. And she says, yes, cats are trainable. OK, so let's start with, like, a basic training thing, teaching a cat to respond to the cat's name and to come when you call it. So as a positive reinforcer, you recommend, you know, a treat. And one of the things you do is have meat paste in a syringe. I mean, I don't even know where to get meat paste. I've never even heard of meat paste. ELLIS: (Laughter) So I... GROSS: Oh, and, by the way, I should mention the syringe, it's not to inject the cat. You just kind of squirt it out of the syringe, and so the cat can lick it off the end of it. There's no needle in it. ELLIS: Yeah, absolutely. GROSS: Is syringe the right word to use? ELLIS: Yeah. Yeah. We would call it a syringe, certainly. And then it's a syringe without a needle, so the plastic part of the syringe, if you like. GROSS: Right. ELLIS: But actually, I have a 2-year-old and during weaning off my little boy, I discovered these, like, squeezy tubes that have a spoon attached to them that you can squeeze the tube, and it squeezes the baby food out onto a spoon. And I thought, these are fantastic for training cats because you can squeeze it straight into a spoon, and the cat licks it off the spoon. So it's amazing what things you can find (laughter) which you're not expecting in life at all. But meat paste - there are some cat food that comes canned, and it's like a patty. And you can loosen that patty with a little bit of water to make paste. And I also have a separate very small food mixer, so that I can blend my cat's regular cat meat into a paste, which it sounds a bit disgusting, but trust me, once you've done it once or twice, it's not a problem. And you can buy human-grade meat paste as well. In the U.K., people spread it on their sandwiches, and these kinds of things. You just have to make sure in the ingredients, it doesn't have any additional ingredients that could be toxic to cats. It's worth definitely checking with your vet. GROSS: Spreading it on sandwiches does not sound great to me, but thanks for the advice. ELLIS: No, it's not. (LAUGHTER) ELLIS: It's not something I would eat (laughter), hence why the cat gets it. GROSS: So getting back to teaching a cat to respond to its name and to come when you call it, walk us through the process for doing that. ELLIS: Sure. GROSS: That seems like the very basic training. ELLIS: Yeah, definitely. So most people's cats know their names already, but where people tend to go wrong is they think, oh, he knows his name. I'll use his name to get him to come to me. But because we use their names all the time, it's not a command to say come to me. It's just a word that we say to them that they know they need to give their attention to us. So the first thing we need to do is think about what word are we going to use that actually means I want you to move your body over towards me and stop when you get to me? We tend to use come or here or any word that works well for you. So the word of the cat - the cat's name, let's say I'm training Cosmos, my cat. I would say the word Cosmos to get his attention, but then I would always say the word come to tell him the command of what I'd like you to do, now I've got your attention, is to come towards me. So you have to think about what that word's going to be, first of all. But we don't use that word until a little bit further down the training. The first thing we do is we make sure the cat is actually really quite close to us when we start teaching the recall. And when I say close, I'm meaning like within a meter or two meters, definitely within the same room. And we show the cat that we have something that it really likes - so most commonly food. And so if you've got your food in the paste, you might need to squirt a little bit of that paste out and let the cat smell it or if you've got food in a tub, if you've got some biscuits, you can rattle that to show the cat that you've got it. The cat should come to you purely because it knows you've got food, and it's motivated for that food. So choose a time when the cat's hungry. Choose a food it really, really likes. So as soon as the cat gets up and starts to walk towards you - and we're only talking, at this stage, a few steps - you then give that cat that reward. And you repeat that in different locations, in different places in the house, and you gradually increase the distance between you and the cat. After doing that in different locations within the house and doing it at different distances which are increasing, we can start to do it when the cat can no longer see us. It can just hear us. And so that's quite good fun. When you really know that you've trained well, you can be in a completely different room of the house, call the cat, give your cue word and see if the cat comes. Only once you've got it that good with it then I take it outdoors. So we're generalizing all the time what the cat's learned to different locations. And that's what makes it really strong. GROSS: So once the cat has mastered this training and comes when you call it by saying come, at what point can you stop giving the cat food each time the cat comes and will the cat at some point think like, well, I'm not going to come any more, there's nothing in it for me? ELLIS: (Laughter) Yeah. OK. So it's a little bit like - imagine the food - it's a little bit like your pay for going to work. We wouldn't go to work for nothing ever, really. There has to be some reward at some point, but that reward doesn't have to come every single time once the animal has learned what the cue word means and has got the behavior mastered. What we tend to find in animal training - and this is not just the case for cats. It's for all animals - is that once you've taught a behavior, in order to maintain that behavioral response really strongly, intermittent reinforcement is the best kind. And by that, what we mean is that you don't give a reward every single time. It sort of keeps the cat guessing. They don't know if running toward you this time will get the food or it will be the next time. And that actually makes the behavior more likely to happen. BIANCULLI: That's Sarah Ellis speaking with Terry Gross. Ellis is the co-author of ""The Trainable Cat,"" which is now out in paperback. We'll hear more of their conversation after a break, and film critic David Edelstein will review ""Novitiate,"" the new movie about an order of nuns set in 1964 during the early years of the Vatican II reforms. I'm David Bianculli, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF ROY HARGROVE'S ""EV'RYBODY WANTS TO BE A CAT"") BIANCULLI: This is FRESH AIR. I'm David Bianculli in for Terry Gross back with more of Terry's interview with feline behavior specialist Sarah Ellis. She' co-author of the book ""The Trainable Cat,"" which is now out in now out in paperback. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST) GROSS: So cats are - they're very demanding about certain things, like when they want food. They know that you feed them and they're hungry, and they want you to feed them. They will tell you either by meowing a lot or by biting your foot or scratching your leg - or there are sweeter ways of doing it than that, but there are the more (laughter) assertive ways. So how do you train a cat to, like, not bite you or scratch you? Oh, let me get to another example. This is the best. When you're sleeping - it's your day to sleep late. It's Saturday. You want to sleep late. Your cat doesn't know it's Saturday. Your cat doesn't care that it's Saturday. It wants to be fed at 6:30 in the morning. And so it jumps onto the bed or walks up to the pillow, sticks its paw in your eye (laughter) and says time to get up. How do you train a cat not to do that? ELLIS: OK, so those behaviors happen in the first place because the cats have trained us. We may not be aware of that at the time, but that's basically what's happened. Cats are not necessarily born meowing and screaming at us for food. It's a behavior that they learn. They're also not born innately to bite our noses when we sleep and scratch our eyes when we sleep. Again, it's another behavior that they try out through trial and error, learn that it has a very, very - it's very effective 'cause it gets exactly the response they would like, and therefore they use it again and again. So the first thing I would say is that owners who have found that their cats are meowing incessantly for food and driving them bonkers is to think about what have you done in the past when your cat has done those behaviors? It is likely that you have gone, oh, goodness me, he's meowing again, just give him some food for him to be quiet. What we've done, remember, is we've reinforced the meowing behavior. So we're just going to make it worse and worse and worse for ourselves 'cause our cats are going to go, oh, that is a behavior that I need to do to get food. And if one day we think, I'm not going to do that anymore, I'm really sick of him meowing for food and I don't want him to do that, I want to try and stop him doing that, and day one, he meows and he meows and you're really strong and you think, no, he's not going to get food for that. And day two and day three - and then by day four, you've had a really, really bad day at work and you're really tired and you've got a bad headache and he is still meowing for food and you think, no, no, I'm going to be strong-willed here. He's not going to get food now. He's going to have to wait until he's quiet another time and then he can have food. And you let him meow for much, much longer than normal, and then you just can't take it anymore and you give him the food. You've made the whole situation even worse because now the cat's learned, oh, I have to meow for, like, 20 minutes instead of 10 minutes for you to give me the food. So what we have to warn owners in that situation is we have to put the behavior on what we call an extinction schedule, if we want to use a real scientific term. That is that this behavior is no longer reinforced. So if you wake me up in the middle of the night, I will no longer get up and feed you just so I can go back to bed. What we need to explain to owners is if they can be really strong with that extinction schedule and just make sure at every occurrence of that behavior they do not reward it, is that it will stop. GROSS: I think a common problem that a lot of pet owners face is that, you know, they have, say, a cat and they want to also adopt another cat or a dog or they have a new baby that's about to arrive, and you have to acclimate the cat that you already have to the newcomer and vice versa. And you have a lot of suggestions for training the cat to deal with the new baby or the new animal that's coming to the house. Can you take us through some of those steps? ELLIS: Yeah, sure. So as humans, we're really naturally very, very sociable. We like extending our families, we like having - if we love cats, we want more cats. The cat doesn't see the world like that at all. Remember, it's evolved from a solitary animal. And so suddenly being asked to share its territory with somebody or something that's very unfamiliar to it can be a real - really quite stressful experience for a cat. So while we might welcome with open arms a new baby or a new cat, and we have an understanding that this already is a family member for us, the cat doesn't. For the cat, it's - the analogy would be like if a - you just came home from work and a stranger was sleeping in your bed. It's really quite a sort of freak-out situation. But when cats - they do have the ability to form social relationships with one another, and it really depends on the individual cat to what extent they can. The way that they do so and the way that they maintain those social relationships is very often through scent, through - they have very, very good sense of smell. And while we generally recognize our family members through sight and through the sound of their voices, for cats, it will be through their - how they smell. So the first thing that we try to do when we're trying to introduce them to a new cat or a new baby, et cetera, is to think about all the sensory information that that new being brings, particularly smell but also sight and sound, and gradually introduce the cat to them over a slow period of time and in a way that the sensory elements are, in their first instance, quite dilute and then come right up to their sort of real level of what they are. GROSS: How do you introduce a new person's smell or a new animal's smell to a cat? ELLIS: OK, so we're going to use an example of a new cat. If we brought a new cat home from the shelter, we would want to keep it in a completely different part of the house from the resident cat, ideally a single room so that that new cat gets a chance to get used to one area that's not too big before we introduce it to other areas. And one of the first ways that we can introduce the two cats to each other's smell is simply by swapping the bedding, taking the bedding that they've been sleeping on, which will be heavily impregnated with their scent, and placing that in each other's territories, making sure that they still have some bedding of their own, as well 'cause, remember, they feel safe and secure when the area smells of them. Cats produce scent, which we cannot detect. Our noses are not strong enough to be able to - or good enough to be able to detect it. And then they also produce these chemicals known as pheromones that are species-specific. So we - they mean nothing to us. We cannot detect them. And they're produced from in between the toes, at the base of the tail, down the flanks but primarily around the face. So do you know under the chin, they love to be scratched and just behind the whiskers on the cheeks, and do you know those areas in front of their ears where there seems to be a lot less hair between the ears and the eyes? GROSS: Yeah. ELLIS: That area there is a very concentrated area where - of sebaceous glands that produce these facial pheromones, these specific chemicals that cats use to communicate with one another. So rubbing a cloth over these facial regions will impregnate that cloth with a scent of that individual cat, which if we smelt that cloth, we would smell nothing. But if we put that into the environment of the other cat, they would very much be able to detect the presence of another cat there. GROSS: And you also have pictures of how you trained your cat at home to accept a second cat. So you have both cats in walled-off spaces but in the same room. So, like, there's some kind of, like, little fence between them or their own - they're each in their own little crates. So they're in the same room, but they're completely protected from each other so that they learn to acclimate to each other without fear of being attacked. ELLIS: Yeah, so once they've got used to the smell of each other and they've heard each other and they're happy with all those things, then we would physically introduce them so that they could see each other. And by this stage, they should be able to recognize each other by smell. So it shouldn't be like, oh, my goodness, who is this creature in my house because they've already smelt this animal and they'll match the smell. But as a safety measure, we would always make sure that they can't physically interact at the beginning beyond just a nose-to-nose greeting. When cats tend to meet each other, they do so by sniffing each other at their noses. And then if they are well-known to one another and part of the same familial group, they may go on to then facial rub. But for cats, when we're introducing them to each other, a nose-to-nose touch or sniff is simply enough that that's all we would be really looking for with no agonistic or hostile behaviors. And so they're able to do this through a barrier, through a mesh door or through a baby gate. But we've prevented the opportunity for any hostile behavior in the eventuality that it did occur because we know from scientific study that if at the first true meeting, cats fight, then the chances of us being able to get those cats to live together is really, really difficult. And the first meeting is really crucial. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Sarah Ellis. She's a cat behavior specialist and co-author of the new book, ""The Trainable Cat."" Let's take a short break here, then we'll talk some more. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF GOLDENBOY'S ""KITTENS OF LUST"") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is cat behavior specialist Sarah Ellis. She's co-author of the new book, ""The Trainable Cat,"" and she insists cats can be trained. A lot of people who have cats have problems with the cat urinating outside of the litter box, and that's an example - like, I have no clue how you would train a cat to not do that. ELLIS: Yeah, the - one of the things is people often think you have to teach a cat to use the litter tray or the litter box, and you don't. You don't have to teach kittens to use the litter box. When they feel a substance under their feet that's very fine and rakable, instinctively they will toilet on it. So the reasons that sometimes they don't use the litter box is because the litter box is not clean enough. Remember, they have this really, really good sense of smell. And while we might not be able to smell the odors coming from it, the cats certainly can. Their noses are closer to the soiled litter and that they have this much better, much more acute sense of smell. And they're fastidious about being clean. So if that litter tray has not been - a litter box has not been scooped in the morning or in the evening, they might choose not to use it. Often, cat litters are designed with us as a consumer in mind rather than our cat, and they are not desirable to our cat in terms of the sensation they create on their feet. They might not be fine and rakable enough or we may place the litter box in an area that the cat doesn't feel is safe and secure. Lots of people put them in their basement next to their tumble dryer or their laundry machine or the washing machine. And for a cat, it's horrible to have that vibration or that noise right next to when they want to go to the bathroom. So these are some of the reasons that cats might not want to use the litter box. There is a whole other range of reasons that are medical related. And so we always, always advise if your cat is not using the litter box, to make sure the first thing you do is to take it to the vet's. So it's not just a simple case of being able to train the cat to use the litter box, it's more that they instinctively know how to do that. It's just that the litter box provided to them is perhaps not desirable because of cleanliness, the substrate that's in it or its location or that it has to share it with another cat. And if those two cats in the home do not consider each other part of their same social group, then they were not going to share a toilet together. GROSS: You know, we're talking about, like, training cats and why that's good for the cat and good for the people. Cats, especially indoor cats, need exercise. And so play is not only, like, a fun activity for the cat and the person but it's also, like, really healthy for the cat. I sometimes wonder if my cat understands that he's engaged in a very Sisyphean activity because (laughter) once - (laughter) like, especially, like, with a laser toy, like, there's no way you're going to actually capture that laser beam, you know? And even with, like, the feather toys - the wand feather toys - like, what do you do with it once you've captured it, you know? You play with it a while and then I'm going to whip it around again and then you capture it again and then I'm going to whip it around again. You know what I'm saying? Like, do cats get frustrated by the ways we play with them? ELLIS: Yeah, they can. And I'll come onto that. But first of all, I think - I'm really pleased you brought up the subject of play 'cause for me, it's not an optional extra in cat ownership. It's not a fun thing to do if you have the time. It is as important as feeding them and providing them with a litter box. It's an absolute basic welfare need, particularly for cats that are indoor-only because the cat, as it's evolved and as we've domesticated it and even as we've selectively bred it and got these pedigree cats, we've never selected to get rid of the predatory behavior and the hunting behavior. And so they still have this desire to perform predatory behavior. And in the wild, they would hunt, you know, approximately 10 times a day. So you imagine they've got this instinct to do this behavior. But in an indoor-only environment, they've got no outlet for it. So really for welfare point of view, we have to offer the cat an appropriate outlet and play is a brilliant, brilliant way of doing that because when they play, they're using exactly the same predatory behaviors. The idea that play could be frustrating for a cat really comes from the idea that we are not allowing the cat to express - or an opportunity to do all of the different predatory behaviors. So if you're chasing a laser beam, a little laser light that's produced from a little box or your cat is chasing feathers on the end of a wand, the chase is only one element of the predatory sequence. There is the locate, the stalk, the stare, the chase, the pounce, which is part of the capture, the killing bite and the consume. And so it's important that we, during play and during feeding, we provide opportunity for all of these behaviors, then we're much, much, much less likely to cause any form of frustration. I think we find it quite amusing when we're playing with cats to make sure that the cat actually can't catch the toy that we're playing with, if it's the feathers on a wand, because then they do these beautiful acrobatics for us as they attempt to catch it. GROSS: Exactly, yes (laughter). ELLIS: But it's so, so important we let them catch it because that is the reward, not every time. Remember, this sort of intermittent reinforcement. They wouldn't catch a mouse every time they hunted. They wouldn't be that good. But we need to think to ourselves when playing with cats, let them catch it now and again, especially when we end a play session. End it on a session where they're allowed to capture it and really have a good chew and bite at it. GROSS: So sometimes what's frustrating for the person is that the cat obviously really wants to play. And you get out the wand toy and you start kind of flipping it around, and the cat is spending, like, minutes just kind of watching it intently. And it's like, come on, play. (LAUGHTER) GROSS: Do something (laughter). ELLIS: Yeah. So quite often what's happening there is that the owner is making the pretend prey, so the feathers on the end of the wand, behave in an unrealistic way that a prey item would not normally. So I've never seen a mouse, for example, you know, fly through the air doing 360 degrees. (LAUGHTER) ELLIS: But yet we expect our cats to chase that and capture that. So it's about teaching owners to make sure that a toy on the end of that wand mimics what a mouse or a bird would do. And then you'll find that the cat really gets engaged. And the more they're allowed to capture it - remember they've been rewarded for that behavior - the more they'll think, this is achievable. I can capture this pretend mouse or pretend bird, but to them, it probably feels real at that moment in time. I'm going to have a shot at going for this one because it's within my ream. So it's just about adjusting our expectations a little bit. GROSS: Sarah Ellis, it's been great to talk with you. Thank you so much. ELLIS: Thank you. It's been a pleasure.

Seavey denies the charge and has withdrawn from the 2018 dog sled race in protest. Last week, the Iditarod Trail Committee announced that at the March finish in Nome this year, four dogs from a single team had tested positive for the drug tramadol. The committee initially declined to name the musher involved. However, competitors kept up pressure to release the name of the accused musher. On Monday, the Iditarod Official Finishers Club released a statement signed by 83 current and former competitors calling for the musher to be named within 72 hours, according to The Associated Press. Seavey, now 30, came in second in this year's Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race behind his father, 57-year-old Mitch Seavey. In a YouTube video, a visibly agitated Dallas Seavey denied any wrongdoing and fired back at the race organizers, saying he had been cooperating with them to clear things up. ""I did nothing wrong,"" Seavey said in the video. ""I have never knowingly broken any race rule. I have never given any banned substance to my dogs,"" he said, adding that he fully expects to be banned but that he doesn't care ""if I never make another cent"" from the sport, which he said ""is my life."" He said he spent several months trying to explain how his dogs showed positive for the drug, but instead was ""thrown under the bus."" ""I believe this was given to my dogs maliciously,"" he said. ""That's one of the options. I think that is the most likely option. There are numerous ways that could have been done."" As we wrote in last week's story: ""[T]he board said it was revising the rules on doping by shifting the burden of proof from race officials to the mushers. ""In future, mushers will be held accountable for a positive test unless they can prove the drugs were administered the drug outside their control. Previously, the rule could be interpreted so that race officials would need to prove the doping was intentional, AP says.""

npr,"October 23, 2017",CRISPR Bacon: Chinese Scientists Create Genetically Modified Low-Fat Pigs," Here's something that may sound like a contradiction in terms: low-fat pigs. But that's exactly what Chinese scientists have created using new genetic engineering techniques. In a paper published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the scientists report that they have created 12 healthy pigs with about 24 percent less body fat than normal pigs. The scientists created low-fat pigs in the hopes of providing pig farmers with animals that would be less expensive to raise and would suffer less in cold weather. ""This is a big issue for the pig industry,"" says Jianguo Zhao of the Institute of Zoology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, who led the research. ""It's pretty exciting.""

 The animals have less body fat because they have a gene that allows them to regulate their body temperatures better by burning fat. That could save farmers millions of dollars in heating and feeding costs, as well as prevent millions of piglets from suffering and dying in cold weather. ""They could maintain their body temperature much better, which means that they could survive better in the cold weather,"" Zhao said in an interview. Other researchers call the advance significant. ""This is a paper that is technologically quite important,"" says R. Michael Roberts, a professor in the department of animal sciences at the University of Missouri, who edited the paper for the scientific journal. ""It demonstrates a way that you can improve the welfare of animals at the same as also improving the product from those animals — the meat."" But Roberts doubts the Food and Drug Administration would approve a genetically modified pig for sale in the United States. He's also skeptical that Americans would eat GMO pig meat. ""I very much doubt that this particular pig will ever be imported into the USA — one thing — and secondly, whether it would ever be allowed to enter the food chain,"" he says. The FDA has approved a genetically modified salmon, but the approval took decades and has been met with intense opposition from environmental and food-safety groups. Others say they hope genetically modified livestock will eventually become more acceptable to regulators and the public. ""The population of our planet is predicted to reach about 10 billion by 2050, and we need to use modern genetic approaches to help us increase the food supply to feed that growing population,"" says Chris Davies, an associate professor in the school of veterinary medicine at Utah State University in Logan, Utah. Zhao says he doubts the genetic modification would affect the taste of meat from the pigs. ""Since the pig breed we used in this study is famous for the meat quality, we assumed that the genetic modifications will not affect the taste of the meat,"" he wrote in an email. The Chinese scientists created the animals using a new gene-editing technique known as CRISPR-Cas9. It enables scientists to make changes in DNA much more easily and precisely than ever before. Pigs lack a gene, called UCP1, which most other mammals have. The gene helps animals regulate their body temperatures in cold temperatures. The scientists edited a mouse version of the gene into pig cells. They then used those cells to create more than 2,553 cloned pig embryos. Next, scientists implanted the genetically modified cloned pig embryos into 13 female pigs. Three of the female surrogate mother pigs became pregnant, producing 12 male piglets, the researchers report. Tests on the piglets showed they were much better at regulating their body temperatures than normal pigs. They also had about 24 percent less fat on their bodies, the researchers report. ""People like to eat the pork with less fat but higher lean meat,"" Zhao says. The animals were slaughtered when they were six months old so scientists could analyze their bodies. They seemed perfectly healthy and normal, Zhao says. At least one male even mated, producing healthy offspring, he says.

npr,"October 20, 2017",Do You Care If Your Fish Dinner Was Raised Humanely? Animal Advocates Say You Should," At some point or another, we've all cringed at the videos: lame cows struggling to stand; egg-laying hens squeezed into small, stacked cages; hogs confined to gestation crates, unable to walk or turn. Over the past decade, animal advocates have made great strides informing us of some of the problems with how many of our favorite proteins are raised. They've also made progress bringing change to the industry by pressuring large-scale retailers — from Target to McDonald's — to commit to sourcing livestock raised with higher welfare standards. But one important protein source has  been missing almost entirely from the conversation: seafood. Mercy for Animals, a U.S.-based animal welfare group, says that's about to change. The group says it is beginning to lay the groundwork for a campaign that will target the aquaculture industry and shine a light on the conditions in which finfish like salmon, tilapia, catfish, trout, pangasius and other species are raised. ""More and more fish are being farmed in intense factory farms,"" says Nick Cooney, executive vice president at Mercy for Animals. ""At the same time, there's an increasing amount of research discovering just how intelligent and social fish are as individuals."" Do consumers care? Mercy for Animals' own in-house studies suggest yes — and offer a roadmap of the objections the group is likely to raise with the aquaculture industry. Concerns like too many fish routinely crammed into pens and tanks, fish being raised in dirty water, high disease and mortality rates. The group, a vegan organization, also cites slaughter methods it finds most inhumane — like letting fish suffocate in open air, chilling them while still alive, or cutting their gills without stunning. And then there's the parasites known as sea lice, which feed on farmed salmon, costing the industry nearly $1 billion a year in losses.   ""For individual consumers, our goal is simply to educate them on the way these animals are being treated,"" says Cooney. ""Our research studies have found that when people learn about these things — that half the fish being used in the food industry are coming from factory farms, or are confined in tanks with dirty water; that sea lice eats away the flesh and faces of fish — that educating them leads to more compassionate choices. And for large companies, our hope in the coming years is that if we show them their customers care, they'll eliminate the worst practices in their supply chains."" Mercy for Animals may have one important thing going for it — timing. Humane treatment of fish is a topic that's starting to bubble up elsewhere. Seafood industry gatherings like the Seafood Summit and the American Fisheries Society meetings are now including sessions focused on welfare issues for farm-raised fish. Supermarkets like Whole Foods are addressing the issue by including language in their seafood standards requiring producers to minimize stress, and have gone so far as to stop carrying live lobster in their stores. And in Seattle, a pair of commercial fishermen recently launched a new fishing vessel that they claim is designed to humanely harvest the wild Pacific cod they catch. But will eaters care what fish feel? Industry representatives say they paid close attention when animal advocacy groups went after the egg-laying hen and hog industries, but say they aren't convinced eaters will prioritize humane treatment for fish in the same way. ""I'm not sure fish will capture the conscience of the public in the same way warm-blooded, furry animals have. People in this country don't see fish as sentient animals, with a conscience requiring the same welfare standards they'd give to a brown-eyed calf,"" says Craig Watson, who chairs the aquatic animal welfare committee for the National Aquaculture Association (NAA), a U.S.-based group of seafood growers. But it's a topic many in aquaculture are thinking more about, including veterinarian Stephen Frattini, president of the Center for Aquatic Animal Research and Management, who has spoken about fish welfare at industry conferences. ""As humans, we've utilized terrestrial animals as food, but also to pull carts and plow fields. And along the way, a moral contract evolved that acknowledged we should provide for them in a way beyond not being cruel to them,"" Frattini says. ""But with fish, we're not there yet. We [as eaters] have yet to really struggle with that."" Indeed, defining what constitutes humane treatment of fish may be a tricky proposition of its own. For one thing, the debate over whether fish are sentient and feel pain is far from settled. ""It depends on who you talk to,"" says Watson, who also runs the Tropical Aquaculture Laboratory at the University of Florida. He says he and many others think ""the science is clear that fish lack the neurophysiology to feel pain. They don't have the brain structure — a developed neocortex where pain occurs in higher vertebrates."" Watson notes the growing body of literature suggesting that there's a part of a fish's brain that can feel pain or emotion. But he says the science is still pretty clear. ""Fish don't have the equipment for higher processes similar to ours."" But in a way, he says, the answer almost doesn't matter. ""To me, it's not an argument of whether fish are emotional and conscious, that's a personal belief in many ways. What's important is the welfare of the animal."" What constitutes humane treatment for fish? But what's deemed humane for one species of fish may be detrimental to another. For example, imposing an across-the-board, low-density requirement might actually create a stressful environment for certain species. Tilapia or arctic char can become aggressive with each other when there are fewer fish in the pen. And then there are fuzzier welfare issues. Are breeding techniques that sometimes result in skeletal deformities a humane issue? What about emerging evidence that accelerated growth rates of some farmed fish have resulted in hearing loss? For some farmed salmon, sea lice are more than just uncomfortable parasites that attach to fish and feed on them—unchecked, they can be deadly and can also infect wild salmon swimming nearby. Last year in Scotland alone, 10 million salmon were destroyed because of parasites, diseases and other problems. Should high mortality rates like that be viewed through a humane lens? ""It's not how many fish you put in the pen, it's how many you harvest. There are a lot of farmed fish that never make it to the plate because of mishaps during the farming process,"" says George Leonard, chief scientist at Ocean Conservancy. ""Should we as a society care about the suffering of those fish that never make it to the plate? That isn't a science question. That is a moral question."" The issue is on the radar of industry certification groups like Best Aquaculture Practices, which includes an entire section on animal health and welfare in its standards. The Aquaculture Stewardship Council says welfare provisions are included in its current standards to address issues like stocking densities and veterinary care, but it does not have a separate standard for the 12 species it currently certifies. The National Aquaculture Association's official policy on animal welfare also encourages humane practices including quick slaughter, though it specifically warns against anthropomorphizing standards around pain or intelligence. ""What concerns people like me is the Mercy for Animal groups don't understand the fundamental biology of these animals, yet they want to dictate to us how to best grow the fish,"" says Randy MacMillian, an NAA board member and vice president of Clear Springs Foods, an Idaho-based trout farm. ""As fish farmers, our mission is to provide U.S. consumers with environmentally sustainable, wholesome, high-quality seafood at affordable prices. We have to look at husbandry conditions. We're looking at feed conversion [the amount of feed it takes to grow one pound of fish], mortality, morbidity — and we use those metrics to inform us if we're doing a good job,"" he says. Mercy for Animals will have some daunting hurdles in its path as it tries to shift the aquaculture industry: The vast majority of the farmed fish Americans eat comes from countries like China, Indonesia, Canada, Norway, Chile and Ecuador. ""Welfare rights are primarily a Western phenomenon,"" says Fred Conte, an extension aquaculture specialist with the University of California, Davis. ""You go to Central America or China and you're not going to find welfare standards."" And many consumers already feel overwhelmed and confused with the complex decisions they face at the seafood counter: Is the fish farmed or wild? Is it from a sustainable source? Does it contain mercury or other contaminants? Was slave labor used in its production? Is the label accurate — or has that snapper been swapped for something else along the way? Adding the question, ""Was this fish farmed humanely?"" might be a tough sell. Conte says ultimately, society will decide whether to take up the humane treatment of fish. ""Right now, no one can make the definitive statement: Fish feel pain like humans feel pain. It's an open debate,"" says Conte. ""Before science comes up with that evidence, society is going to move in a direction. Industry will respond to market pressures. If society chooses not to believe a fish feels pain, there will not be much pressure on the industry.""

That seems to have been the case for a certain canine trainee named Lulu at the Central Intelligence Agency. The black Labrador was in an intensive course of study to learn how to sniff out bombs. But Lulu just wasn't that interested. ""[It's] imperative that the dogs enjoy the job they're doing,"" the CIA writes in a news release on Wednesday announcing Lulu's reassignment to her handler's living room. If you're a dog, sniffing out explosives is apparently one of those jobs that you either love or hate. And Lulu just couldn't muster the mojo for poking her muzzle into metal cans and around concrete blocks hoping to catch the distinctive aroma of C-4 or some other bomb component. We’ll miss Lulu, but it was right decision for her &amp; we wish her all the best in her new life!https://t.co/nPZl6YWNKb pic.twitter.com/Mbcr9C7wUY ""Sometimes, even when a pup tests well and they successfully learn how to detect explosive odors, they make it clear that being an explosive detection K9 is not the life for them,"" according to the agency. ""A few weeks into training, Lulu began to show signs that she wasn't interested in detecting explosive odors,"" the release said, adding that it is sometimes a temporary phase for canine trainees. For Lulu however, even treats and playtime couldn't motivate her. ""[She] was clearly not enjoying herself any longer,"" the CIA said. In such cases, the agency says, ""the handler or handler's family is given the chance to adopt them. Most handlers, of course, choose to do so. ...

npr,"October 17, 2017","Amid The Horrors Of Wildfire, A Tale Of Survival And Singed Whiskers"," The toll from the Northern California wildfires continues to mount. More than 40 people have perished. Hundreds of homes have been destroyed. Farms, cars, livelihoods, artifacts of lives lived. In times like these, sometimes the only thing people have to hold onto are the little stories of survival. This one is about goats and one very loyal dog. It was 1 o'clock in the morning on Oct. 9 when Claire Mollard's husband called and told her to pack up some valuables and think about evacuating their home in the Santa Rosa hills in Northern California. Her husband, Josh Weil, is an emergency room doctor and operations chief at a nearby hospital and was working the night shift. He'd heard chatter on the paramedics' radio that the massive Tubbs Fire was heading toward their home. Mollard woke her 15-year old daughter, Sophie, and told her to get dressed. Then she took some belongings out to the car and saw the glow in the sky — it was the color of merlot wine. A few minutes later, she knew they were in trouble.

 The green pastures where Lucy and Ethel grazed before the Tubbs Fire decimated parts of Northern California wine country. ""The whole sky was red now and the wind was blowing like crazy,"" Mollard recalls. But it was the noise that struck her most. ""It was so loud, just roaring, howling."" She raced inside, yelled for Sophie and grabbed the family's two dogs. They could see the flames just a hundred yards away. Mollard made one last dash into the house to find their cat, but it was too dark and smoky. The power was out. She opened doors and windows, hoping he'd escape. By then, the fire was ""raining down on us,"" Mollard says. As they sped away, she saw their goats, Lucy and Ethel. They were standing solemn in the pasture. A little farther north, in the mountains of Sonoma County near Calistoga, Roland Hendel and his 14-year old daughter, Ariel, were also in trouble. The smell of smoke had been thick in the air all evening. Around 11 o'clock, Hendel went to a small deck on the roof of his house. He watched the sky glow orange, and then he saw the flames. ""I just stood there and watched as the flames got bigger and bigger."" And then he ran. He and his daughter managed to get Tessa, one of their two Great Pyrenees herding dogs, into the car, but the other one, Odin, wouldn't leave the goats. The Hendels have eight pet goats that they rescued from slaughter as newborns. His daughter bottle-fed them all. They were part of the family, and it was Odin's job to watch over and protect them from predators. ""Odin is sitting there and he's looking at me and he's not going anywhere,"" Hendel says. ""So I said, 'OK, take care of them.' Then we got the hell out."" 
                Odin, Roland Hendel's dog, protected his goats during the wildfire that destroyed Hendel's home.

 Odin, Roland Hendel's dog, protected his goats during the wildfire that destroyed Hendel's home. Two days after Hendel and his daughter fled for their lives, they went back to their land in the redwoods. It was dangerous — the main roads were blocked and fires were still burning. But they were desperate to check on Odin and the goats. ""We expected either that the entire property would be decimated and Odin and the goats would be dead or that the fire would have missed us, and the house, the land and the animals would be OK."" What they discovered was both the worst and the best of outcomes. The house was gone, the trucks were gone, everything was ash and gray. Except for the goats. All eight of them had survived. Odin did, too, limping, with singed fur and melted whiskers. But his tail still wagged. Hendel thinks he knows what happened. ""What I think is Odin herded the goats into the middle of the pasture where there are a bunch of large rocks and kept them there. That's what saved them, I think."" Of his goats, Hendel says, ""They are magical beings."" After another few days of anxious waiting, the entire herd and the dogs, Odin and Tessa, were taken to safety. They are now being cared for at a temporary farm-animal shelter at the Sonoma County fairgrounds. Josh Weil was finally able to get back to his home late Tuesday afternoon. When he approached the long drive leading up to his house, he was hopeful. The mailbox was still standing, with a letter his wife had put in the day the fire struck perfectly intact. The house itself was up around a bend. When he made the turn, there was nothing left. 
                Claire Mollard managed to get her 15-year-old daughter, Sophie, and the family's two dogs out before wildfire consumed their home in Santa Rosa.

 Claire Mollard managed to get her 15-year-old daughter, Sophie, and the family's two dogs out before wildfire consumed their home in Santa Rosa. ""It was a gut punch,"" Weil says. ""Everything was just ash and total destruction. I was trying to figure out where the entry way was and the garage. I could make out only an axle and wheel of my wife's car. And the landscape around the house as far as you could see was just gone. "" As he shuffled through some things — watching objects disintegrate into ash as he poked at them — he heard the noise. It was unmistakable: a bleat that could only come from a goat. There, standing in the drive were Lucy and Ethel, singed and hungry and fine. Somebody, probably the firefighters, had even left them a bowl of water. He has no real idea how they survived, only a theory. ""All I can think is the pasture was just low grass and so the fire couldn't sustain itself there."" He called his wife. ""He was saying, the goats are here, the goats are here!"" Mollard says. It was one little wonder amid the loss. And it helped. ""They are our little bright lights,"" she says. Lucy and Ethel are now being housed at a neighbor's barn that survived the blaze. The cat hasn't been found. But the goats have given them hope that maybe he, too, will find a way home.

npr,"October 17, 2017",Scientists Push To House More Lab Monkeys In Pairs," In a small, windowless room at Johns Hopkins University, pigtail macaques jump around in cages. The braver ones reach out between the metal bars to accept pieces of apricot with their long fingers. In one cage, a monkey hangs back in the corner. At first it looks like he's all alone in there, until veterinarian Bob Adams points out, ""No, he's got a friend."" Another monkey is clinging to his back, almost hidden. Not too long ago, these guys wouldn't have had a pal to hold on to. Like humans, monkeys are social animals. But for two decades, researchers here routinely put animals in separate cages after experimentally infecting them with a monkey form of HIV. The concern was that cagemates might swap viruses and mess up the science. Then, a few years ago, Adams urged the research team to try pairing up the animals. It's worked out great, and now each cage houses two buddies. ""Part of the realization that people are coming to is not just that it's not a problem, but that it actually helps to improve the science,"" says Kelly Metcalf Pate, who uses these monkeys to study how HIV can evade treatment. Loneliness can suppress the immune system, Pate notes, and being alone is not what most infected humans experience. ""The majority of patients, regardless of disease that we're looking at, aren't living in isolation,"" she says. But many lab monkeys do live in cages alone. Last year, 109,821 primates were held in research facilities across the United States, according to data collected by the government. Some of those animals were kept for breeding or other non-experimental purposes, but the majority were used to study everything from cancer to diabetes to addiction. In 2014, a survey of labs found that 35 percent of primates being housed indoors for research studies were in cages alone. That's down from 59 percent in 2003, says Kate Baker of Tulane National Primate Research Center, who did both surveys. ""There has been a lot of progress,"" says Baker. But the degree of progress depends on the species, her research suggested. For rhesus macaques, one of the primates most commonly used in labs, the percentage of animals who were singly housed barely budged: Roughly half of those used in experiments lived in cages alone. That isn't how their lives usually start. These monkeys are typically born into breeding colonies that have dozens of animals living together in large social groups. At Yerkes National Primate Research Center in Atlanta, for example, rhesus macaques groom each other and play on climbing structures in outdoor enclosures the size of basketball courts. ""See the little baby right here with the mom, sitting right underneath that blue climbing structure? That baby was probably born in the last two weeks,"" says veterinarian Maria Crane. ""They are extremely acrobatic. It's amazing when you watch them run around and play within these areas, how agile they are."" She said most monkeys remain in a group like this until the age of 3, although ""it depends on the project needs."" As much as possible, she says, researchers try to maintain some kind of social housing for the animals taken to biomedical labs although, again, their fate depends on the requirements of the scientific studies. Going to live in a small cage in an indoor lab is a huge, stressful change for a monkey. And it's even worse if they suddenly have to live by themselves. ""Social housing is the most important thing to a primate. No doubt,"" says Kathleen Conlee of the Humane Society of the United States, who once worked at a primate breeding and research facility. Isolated monkeys can sometimes become emotionally disturbed, says Conlee. ""They go crazy, I guess is the way you can put it, where they can self-mutilate to the point of breaking their skin. We've seen animals have tears in their arms and legs from self-biting, pulling all their hair out to the point where they're bald."" In 1985, she says, amendments to the Animal Welfare Act required labs to care for the psychological well-being of primates, and the importance of social housing was clear. ""Unfortunately when they wrote the standards, a lot of the standards have to do with how you can exempt yourself from social housing,"" says Conlee. ""So while there's an emphasis on it, it's just not happening to the degree that it should."" Lately, however, there's been increased pressure from regulators, including changes to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals used by the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare at the National Institutes of Health, which now calls social housing for nonhuman primates the ""default."" And this comes as scientists are figuring out exactly what it takes to successfully pair monkeys together. After all, just like people, not all monkeys will get along. If two of them get put in a small cage, and they start to fight — there's nowhere to run. Injuries can be serious, even fatal. That's why a couple dozen vets and lab workers gathered for a workshop held earlier this year at Yerkes, to learn about best practices for monkey matchmaking and how to detect any sign of a brewing conflict. ""We're trying to sort of apply the recent science to the practice of how people can do this in their own facilities,"" says Mollie Bloomsmith, the head of behavioral management at Yerkes. That science includes the work of researchers like Kristine Coleman, of the Oregon National Primate Research Center, who has been exploring temperament testing of animals. ""People have found differences in say, shyness and boldness, or inhibition and exploratory behavior,"" says Coleman, adding that her lab has found that female rhesus macaques tend to be more compatible with partners that have similar temperaments. Baker, one of the workshop instructors, says that the ""Holy Grail"" is to have ""an early sign of how this introduction is going to go, so that if it is going badly we can terminate the introduction attempt before anyone gets injured."" Lab workers really care about the monkeys and understand the importance of social housing, says Baker, who notes that monkeys show less stress if they have a familiar partner housed with them or even within sight of them. ""I don't want to make a bad call and get animals wounded, of course,"" says Baker, ""but I also don't want to make a bad call and have animals housed alone that don't need to be."" To understand the importance of using the right methods, consider Augusta University, in Georgia. A couple years ago, federal inspectors went there and found about 50 research monkeys. Almost all of them lived in cages alone. A university official told a local newspaper that the monkeys had lived like that for most of their lives and were too aggressive to be paired up. But the university has made major improvements since then, says Patricia Charlton, director of veterinary services. ""We are now up to 60 percent of the animals being socially housed,"" she tells NPR. What made the difference was hiring a new lab worker with lot of experience with primates, she says. They gradually introduced the animals to each other while watching their behavior carefully. ""It's different ways of looking at these animals that we just were not doing before. It's a learning curve,"" says Charlton. Researchers have also been learning more about when the science doesn't really justify isolating monkeys. It used to be, says Bloomsmith, that researchers just assumed that they needed to singly cage any monkey that had been given a medical implant or had been outfitted with experimental hardware. The thinking was that a cagemate would disturb the devices or pull them out. It turns out, that wasn't true. ""Now it's very widespread that people are socially housing animals with a variety of different types of implants like that and having great success,"" says Bloomsmith. Back at Johns Hopkins, in the lab where infected monkeys now live together in pairs, veterinarian Eric Hutchinson points out that researchers have to keeping trying new things to show how the monkeys' lives can be enhanced without hurting the science. He notes that other scientists doing very similar virus research are still separately housing their monkeys after infection. ""It's not that hard to come up with a reasonable-sounding justification for keeping animals apart,"" says Hutchinson, ""until you hear from somebody else that's doing the exact same thing and housing them together.""

npr,"October 14, 2017",Animals Forced To Evacuate California Wildfires Too," This is a farming area with vineyards and stables. Christy Gentry lives there. Her house in Santa Rosa has been spared. But earlier this week, the fires billowed toward the stables where she works. She and her husband set out on a midnight operation to save the animals and bring them to the Sonoma County Fairgrounds. She joined us from Santa Rosa. Thanks so much for being with us. CHRISTY GENTRY: Absolutely. Thank you so much for having us. SIMON: Christy, what was it like to rescue 26 horses in the dark of midnight and bring them miles away to the fairgrounds? GENTRY: So when we got to the barn, there was a glow on the ridge. We couldn't actually see the flames, but it looked pretty close and there was a lot of smoke and ash in the air. We started with the horses farthest from the main barn, where we were loading, brought them in. We had several volunteers, and within an hour and 20 minutes, all of 26 horses were loaded and on their way safely to the fairgrounds. It was amazing. SIMON: And they were pretty calm because they're used to going to horse shows and stuff. GENTRY: Yeah, they're used to traveling. They were pretty calm. I also think we had a couple that were hysterical, one that we had to wait till the very end and we thought we were going to have to leave. You know, I don't think the horses can really see the fire, but they know what's going on. They know that there's danger. And he was quite hysterical. It took about 10 women - he got loose twice - to load him in. But we finally did get him in the trailer, and everyone was safe. Ponies were caught in vineyards. There's been some chaos to it... SIMON: Yeah. GENTRY: ...For certain. SIMON: How do you get a pony out of the vineyard and into a truck? GENTRY: People go armed with treats and halters, and so they're able to catch them. And, you know, mostly, if you're calm, the horses stay calm. SIMON: Horses eat a lot, don't they? How do you care for every one? GENTRY: Sure thing. Well, many of us were able to grab hay and some supplies as we were evacuating our barn. So we came with food and some items in hand. But the local seed stores have been donating all kinds of hay and shavings and pellets. So we have had, again, tremendous support from the local community, making sure that every horse here is fed. SIMON: Can you smell the smoke, see the fire? GENTRY: There - while we cannot see the fire any longer from where we are, and it's very, very smoky. There's a ton of ash. There has been a ton of ash. Everyone's lungs are, you know, feeling constricted. The dogs are coughing because it's so thick in the air. So the scene itself is still dismal, for sure. SIMON: But people are helping each other. GENTRY: People are coming together. You know, when there's an emergency like this, if the fire happens too fast and you can't get out in time, you have to set the horses free. Well, you got to put halters on, you got to label them. Those can burn off in a fire, so we actually handwrote with a Sharpie pen on all of our horses hooves the phone number. If there is some marking on the horse on - with ink, then we can identify, at least, who to call to find out where the horse will eventually need to be, or to let that person know that we have that horse. SIMON: How do you fill your days there - all these people and horses staying at the fairgrounds? GENTRY: We're caring for other people's animals. Our neighbor's goats are here, their dog. We've got llamas. We have goats. So everyone just sort of has their sectioned area. And we take the horses out, we walk them, we feed them. And then we try to keep in communication with surrounding areas to see, are we going to be able to possibly go home at some point? We're - everyone's just sitting on pins and needles, to be perfectly honest. SIMON: Christy Gentry at the Sonoma County Fairgrounds in Santa Rosa, Calif. Thank you so much. GENTRY: You're welcome. Thank you. SIMON: And tomorrow on WEEKEND EDITION SUNDAY, after wildfires, earthquakes, hurricanes, what's the best way to help? A close look at charities and where your donations go.

npr,"Sep 11,  2017",Proposed power line under Lake Erie sparks concern from residents," It’s called the Lake Erie Connector, and it’s proposed to run 73 miles from Nanticoke, Ont., to Erie County, Penn. About 40 of those miles will be under the Lake Erie. It will connect to the PJM energy sector, which brings power to Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan and 10 other states. ITC Grid Development is in charge of the $1 billion project. Company President Terry Harvill says the power line will make use of excess energy from Canada. And because that country’s power is mostly generated from renewable sources, Harvill says the project could benefit U.S. energy consumers. “There’s cheaper, cleaner energy in Ontario today, so the U.S. can benefit from that in the near term,” he said. The electricity trade between the U.S. and Canada is on the rise. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration there are more than 30 power transmission linkages between the two countries. The Lake Erie Connector project has met resistance from some Pennsylvania homeowners who live in the area where a converter station will be built. Their primary concern is water. Douglas Lavery and his wife have lived in their house in western Erie County for nearly 40 years. His brother lives next door, and they’re among a handful of residents in the rural community.   Lavery worries the project could disrupt their water table and that the new converter station, which is proposed to be nearly the size of a football field and 60 feet tall, could lower their property values.   “We’re not trying to throw up roadblocks, but we want our rights respected, we want our water respected,” he said. “I’ve told several people in meetings water is more valuable than gold and if you don’t have it, you’re never going to get it back.” The Michigan-based company says homeowners don’t need to worry about property values, because the converter station will be set back from the road and buffered by landscaping. ITC also said it plans to use construction techniques that will limit impacts to the area’s water supply. Erie County Executive Kathy Dahlkemper doesn’t expect the project to cause problems. “You have to understand that this is coming into Erie County in probably one of the least populated areas, particularly along the lake,” she said. “So the impact to where people live to their property is actually fairly minimal because of where they are coming in to our county.” She acknowledges the water table concerns from Lavery’s neighborhood. “I know there’s been concerns about that, about disrupting their water table, I know the company has tried to address that, but truthfully I’ve had very little discussion come into our office or into county government or our other offices about this,” she said. Ground breaking for the Lake Erie Connector project is slated for 2018. View the discussion thread.

npr,"October 13, 2017",Dogs And People Have More In Common Than You Might Think," The bond between humans and dogs isn't just psychological or the common love of bacon. It's also genetic. For about 15,000 years, dogs have migrated in lockstep with humans around the globe. They have followed us from Asia into Europe, North America and back to Africa — all the while hunting, protecting and snuggling us. Now it looks as though dog DNA has evolved in lockstep with our DNA. Scientists in China have found evidence that dogs developed protection against malaria in the same way that people in West Africa have. One tiny change in dogs' genes likely boosted their immune response to the malaria parasite, geneticists from Yunnan University reported Tuesday in the journal Molecular Biology and Evolution. The gene — called ADGRE1 — is also linked with malaria protection in people. The findings add to growing evidence that dogs and people have undergone what is called convergent evolution: They've adapted to new environments by independently evolving similar traits. ""The classic example of convergent evolution is altitude adaptation in Tibetans — and their dogs,"" says geneticist Adam Boyko at Cornell University, who wasn't involved in the current study. Tibetans have a special version of a gene that helps their blood cope with low levels of oxygen. The gene — called ESPA1 — turns on a whole bunch of other genes when oxygen levels drop. ""Lo and behold! Dogs in Tibet also have a mutation in ESPA1 that confers resistance to low oxygen levels,"" Boyko says. That finding was published a few years ago by another team in China. Now this new study adds a few more genes to the doggy-human convergence. 
                One of the most famous African dog breeds, the basenji is closely related to street dogs found throughout West Africa.

 One of the most famous African dog breeds, the basenji is closely related to street dogs found throughout West Africa. The data suggest dogs adapted to the diet in West Africa in a similar way as people, by changing the same genes involved with insulin secretion and sensitivity. And they picked up mutations that helped protect them from the intense sunlight in the tropics — just as people have. All this new information comes from an unlikely source: local dogs in Nigeria — which often end up on the street. ""Similar dogs are found all over the Congo, Liberia and Guinea,"" says Boyko, who has studied the genetics of some street dogs. ""They kind of all look the same: skinny brown dogs.""  To look for convergent evolution in people and dogs, Ya-Ping Zhang and his colleagues at Yunnan University sequenced the genomes of 15 local dogs in Nigeria and then compared their genomes with those of European breed dogs, Chinese street dogs and wolves. Right away, the team realized these Nigerian dogs have an ancient pedigree. They are direct descendants of a group of dogs that came to Africa about 14,000 years ago, possibly from the Middle East, and were largely isolated from European and Asian dogs. Eventually, these pioneering dogs also gave rise to basenjis — the famous African breed with short, smooth hair, a curled-up tail and a unique yodel. And they adapted to the tropical environment in West Africa by building up resistance to a malaria-like illness — just like their furless two-legged friends. Who knows? Maybe the secret to stopping malaria is hidden in a skinny, mangy street dog lolling at a bus stop somewhere in Lagos. ""There are about a billion dogs in the world, and probably two-thirds are street dogs,"" Boyko says. ""Not too many geneticists have paid attention to them. But that's changing. I'm glad that street dogs are finally getting some love."" Love — and maybe a little piece of bacon from a geneticist, too? We're all neighbors on our tiny globe.

npr,"October 13, 2017","Jeremy, The Lonely, Left-Twisting Snail, Dies — But Knows Love Before The End"," Jeremy, the rare snail with the left-curling shell whose search for a mate kicked off an international quest, has slithered off this mortal coil. But there's one last twist to the story. Reader, before he died, Jeremy procreated. That's right. The little lefty did it.  You might remember Jeremy from our previous coverage, as reported by NPR's Merrit Kennedy. Jeremy, a brown garden snail, has a shell that twists in the opposite direction from most snails. It's an extremely rare trait. Because Jeremy's mating apparatus is also unusually situated, and he'd only be able to mate with another left-twisting snail, he seemed fated for a life of unwilling chastity. Until the scientists got involved. A BBC callout prompted a global search for a potential partner. Along the way, Jeremy became famous. And two other snails were located — Lefty, from Ipswich, and Tomeau, from Majorca, Spain. It seemed like a happy ending. But then, as Merrit reported this spring, ""what had been a snail fairy tale has turned into something of a tragedy for Jeremy. Its two possible mates proceeded to mate with each other instead. They've been feverishly reproducing, with three batches of eggs between them."" If you're thinking, ""my God, this sounds like a tragic love ballad,"" then you should be friends with Lydia Hiller. She thought the same thing ... and then she wrote it. Fast-forward to the present. Jeremy was found dead on Wednesday. But ""the sad news comes with a bittersweet twist,"" writes the University of Nottingham. ""Shortly before his death, Jeremy was finally able to produce offspring after mating three times with another 'lefty' snail, ensuring that his legacy will live on through continuing genetic studies into his rare mutation."" (Three times! Nice work, Jeremy.) In case you've forgotten how snail mating works, Merrit explained it last November. She spoke to Angus Davison, an evolutionary geneticist at The University of Nottingham who has been Jeremy's dedicated keeper: ""The way snails mate is ""fantastically bizarre,"" Davison says. The carnal act is known as 'traumatic insemination,' and copulation kicks off by mutually stabbing each other with 'love darts' — tiny calcium spears that transfer a hormone. Snails are simultaneous hermaphrodites, he says, meaning that they are both male and female at the same time and will 'reciprocally fertilize each other' and ultimately each produce offspring. ""In a further twist, snails can reproduce on their own because they are hermaphrodites. But Davison says this happens 'very rarely but they'd much prefer to mate with another snail.' Inbreeding, he notes, is 'generally not a good strategy.' "" 
                A baby snail perches on the edge of a bench in a University of Nottingham lab.

 A baby snail perches on the edge of a bench in a University of Nottingham lab. Jeremy mated with Tomeau, the Spanish left-coiler, and Tomeau has now produced a batch of 56 baby snails. About a third of those are likely to be Jeremy's offspring, while ""the remainder will be the result of an earlier liaison with Lefty before its return to Ipswich,"" the university writes. Jeremy's children won't face the same struggle he did. They are all — every one — right-coilers. The University of Nottingham explains the implications: ""The fact that the babies developed right-coiling shells may be because the mother carries both the dominant and recessive versions of the genes that determine shell-coiling direction. Body asymmetry in snails is inherited in a similar way to bird shell colour – just as only the mother's genes determine the colour of a bird egg, only the mother's genes determine the direction of the twist of a snail shell. It is far more likely that left-coiling babies will be produced in the next generation or even the generation after that."" Last year, Davison and some colleagues ""revealed they had discovered a gene that determines whether a snail's shell twists in a clockwise or anti-clockwise direction,"" the university writes.

In addition to Lefty and Tomeau, Davison was alerted to the existence of four more sinistral snails, as they're formally known, all from a farm in Spain. And, of course, they have a new generation of little snails to study. It's all thanks to the initial search, prompted by Jeremy's Lefty Lonely Hearts Club.

npr,"October 11, 2017",Pumas Are Not Such Loners After All," Supposedly solitary pumas actually hang out with their fellow big cats quite often, frequently coming together and hissing and snarling before settling down to share a delicious elk carcass. That's the startling discovery made by scientists who recently tracked 13 pumas — also called mountain lions or cougars — and set up cameras at kill sites. They recorded dozens of peaceful social interactions between these elusive felines. Pumas can live for more than a dozen years in the wild and have huge home ranges that can stretch for hundreds of miles. Scientists used to think that they lived lonely lives and only came together to mate or fight over territory. ""There was really no other reason to come together at all,"" says Mark Elbroch of Panthera. ""People just made a lot of assumptions based on very little data, and those assumptions became mythology, even within the science world."" But in the journal Science Advances, he and his colleagues say they had reason to suspect that the social lives of these mighty carnivores might be more complex. New GPS tracking that let scientists watch the movements of these animals in near real-time was revealing inexplicable meetings. In May of 2012, for example, Elbroch looked at the GPS tracking and saw that a female and her kitten had stopped at a certain location. He noticed that another female with three kittens of her own were moving in that direction. So he and a colleague raced to the spot in the woods and found a dead elk. They pointed cameras at it and later found that the females spent two days together feeding at opposite ends of the same carcass. ""They sort of just sat at either ends of the carcass and weren't particularly friendly to each other. They just sat there and ate. And the kittens would bounce in and feed when they could,"" says Elbroch. ""I can't explain how exciting it was for me to capture, for the first time, an interaction between adult mountain lions. It was just so different than what I expected to happen.""

 Mother and daughter pumas show affection. And it turned out to be a common occurrence. When they followed 13 of the big cats from April of 2012 to March of 2015, they learned that every single cat participated in food sharing. ""All the mountain lions participated,"" says Elbroch. ""That in itself was shocking. There wasn't a lone mountain lion that didn't interact with anybody."" In winter, the cats seemed to get together with pals over a meal every couple of weeks, in feeding episodes that could last for days. ""We found very clear, very interesting patterns to who shared with who,"" says Elbroch. The most dominant was direct reciprocity: if a mountain lion shared with another, the recipient would later return the favor. What's more, the mountain lions generally seemed to organize themselves into a couple of small communities defined by the territories of two dominant males. Cats within these areas socialized more frequently with each other than with outsiders. All of this, says Elbroch, ""completely redefines what we know about mountain lions."" The study found that males, in general, received much more free food than they shared with others. It might be that females got something else in return, such as building a relationship that would provide breeding opportunities or protection from other males that might kill their young. Given that mountain lions have a complex social system apparently built on reciprocity, Elbroch says this raises the question of whether other ""solitary"" carnivores do as well. He also would like to know what effect trophy hunting might have on these social structures. ""What happens when a male is removed,"" he wonders. ""Is there social chaos? Is there quick turnover to maintain those social systems and relationships that are in place? We don't know.""

UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Ray Brown's ""Talkin' Birds."" RAY BROWN, BYLINE: Good morning, and welcome to our show, No. 644, originating live from the Galapagos Islands. (APPLAUSE) SCOTT SIMON, HOST:  Well, Ray Brown got back safely from the Galapagos, which I gather is home to a species of birds that aren't seen anywhere else on Earth. Ray, thanks for coming back to join us. BROWN: Well, thank you - my pleasure, Scott. SIMON: And as we birding people say, let's not beat around the bush. Did you see the blue-footed booby? BROWN: Oh, we saw many blue-footed boobies and also their cousins, the red-footed boobies which are just as spectacular. SIMON: And they were finches that Darwin made famous, right? BROWN: That's right. At his time, it was thought there were 13 of these species of finches. And you know, he wrote his famous ""On The Origin Of Species"" 28 after he left the Galapagos Islands. That's the treatise that's really considered to be the foundation of evolutionary biology and the scientific theory about natural selection. But it's interesting, Scott, because scientists now with DNA studies and such have decided there are many more than 13 species. They're up to 19, I think, at last measure. SIMON: And I gather you went snorkeling. BROWN: We went snorkeling, I think, five times. SIMON: If you're going to try and persuade me there are birds who live under water, I'm going to be very skeptical. BROWN: Well, there are birds that swim under water, most notably the flightless cormorant - it only exists there - whose wings have evolved into these tiny little appendages. So this bird cannot fly, but it can definitely swim. And we did swim with them. And we snorkelled along with some other species that kind of might surprise you - green sea turtles, marine iguanas, Galapagos sea lions, Galapagos penguins. And well, this is a real believe-it-or-not - two species of sharks... SIMON: ...swam underwater with you? BROWN: Yes, indeed. SIMON: Ray, the idea's to avoid sharks, man, not go swimming with them. BROWN: (Laughter) Now you tell me. I'm already back here. (LAUGHTER) SIMON: Yeah. BROWN: But our guide assured us that we needn't be afraid. So we saw these whitetip reef sharks that were maybe 5 feet long. And then we saw these Galapagos sharks, which I understand are a relative or a type of bull shark. SIMON: Oh, bull shark - great. (LAUGHTER) BROWN: I told you, you wouldn't believe me. And yeah, we swam with them and snorkeled with them. It was quite remarkable. SIMON: How's the Galapagos doing? BROWN: I'd say the Galapagos is doing well. You know, they've not surprisingly had lots of challenges from invasive species, for example. People have brought goats there and cats and dogs and pigs and horses and donkeys. I have to say, though, in our seven plus days on the islands, I didn't see any of those invasive creatures. SIMON: And the whole idea is to try and keep the Galapagos pristine. BROWN: Exactly. Yeah, and to preserve those unique species that live there. SIMON: How excited were all these species to be on your radio show, Ray? Can you tell? BROWN: We couldn't get any of them to - as friendly as they are, they just would not talk. SIMON: (Laughter) Ray Brown, host of ""Talkin' Birds"" - thanks so much for being back with us, Ray. BROWN: My pleasure. Thank you, Scott. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""ROCKIN' ROBIN"") DAY: (Singing) The wise, old owl. The big, black crow. SIMON: While you were in the Galapagos, did you see any birds that resemble BJ Leiderman, who writes our theme music? BROWN: (Laughter) I haven't seen a photo of BJ. Could you send it along? And I will get back to you on that. SIMON: All right. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""ROCKIN' ROBIN"") DAY: (Singing) Tweedilly, didilly, deet. Tweet. Tweet. Copyright © 2017 NPR.  All rights reserved.

npr,"October 5, 2017",Light Pollution Can Impact Nocturnal Bird Migration," Right now we're in the peak of the fall migration season. Billions of birds are making their way south. Many species travel at night, and a new study shows how artificial light can affect their journey through darkness. NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: This time of year the night sky is full of birds. KYLE HORTON: Sparrows, warblers, thrushes, grosbeaks, tanagers. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Kyle Horton works at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. He says flying at night makes a lot of sense. HORTON: These birds are effectively running or flying marathons through the air space. And it's cooler at night. The air space is calmer. GREENFIELDBOYCE: And there's fewer predators. The night travelers navigate using the stars and landmarks like rivers and coastlines. As they look down at the world below, they also see bright lights. Horton says there's evidence that birds can sometimes be drawn toward them. HORTON: Things like a low cloud ceiling or fog paired with light, that really disorients migrants. GREENFIELDBOYCE: But this hasn't been studied much, so he decided to do a kind of opportunistic experiment using some really powerful, unique lights. Each year on September 11, New York City has something called the Tribute in Light. To remember the lives lost in the Twin Towers, two vertical columns of light are created by searchlights. HORTON: The lights that you would see maybe one or two, let's say, for a grand opening of something. And we're talking about 88 of those pointed skyward. The magnitude of the light is in many ways overwhelming. GREENFIELDBOYCE: It's been known for years that this draws in migrating birds. They circle around in the beams. If volunteers on the ground see more than a thousand, the tribute gets turned off for about 20 minutes. But Horton and his colleagues used radar data and found many, many more birds than the volunteers could see. HORTON: What we're detecting on the radar are estimates of hundreds of thousands of birds. GREENFIELDBOYCE: More than a million birds were affected over the seven nights in the study. The results are described in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Jeffrey Buler is a researcher at the University of Delaware who also uses radar to study bird migrations. He says the sheer number of birds affected by this light display is surprising. So was the way the birds quickly scattered into the night whenever the lights got turned off. JEFFREY BULER: The figures from the paper are just amazing where they show when the lights are on and when the lights are off and how the numbers of the birds just oscillate up and down. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says this light was so extreme it makes the birds' response easy to see. But his recent research suggests this is happening on a much larger scale. Migrating birds seem to be drawn towards the ordinary nighttime glow of big cities. BULER: We're concerned that we are drawing birds into more urbanized landscapes where there are less suitable habitats for them to stop over. GREENFIELDBOYCE: They could have trouble finding food or be delayed, and that would make their long migrations that much harder. Nell Greenfieldboyce, NPR News. Copyright © 2017 NPR.

 People and cats have always had a businesslike relationship. Where human agriculture goes, a smorgasbord of rats and mice are sure to follow. And distilleries, which turn various grains into grogs, have been battling these pests for centuries. Distillery Cats, a new book by Brad Thomas Parsons, is based on his popular Instagram chronicle of these mousers. Irish and Scottish distilleries were particularly reliant on cats, he writes. In the modern era, the most famous of these cats was Towser the Mouser of Glenturret, Scotland's oldest working distillery, who killed over 28,000 mice during her 24-year tenure, which ended upon her death in 1987. The lethal feline was featured in Guinness World Records for her accomplishments. Here in the United States, distillery cats don't need to be nearly as productive as Towser to earn love and admiration. Parsons' book gives brief synopses of 30 U.S. distilleries (and breweries) and their resident mousers — some of whom are more friend than mouse-foe. In Indianapolis, Hotel Tango Artisan Distillery is unique in that its cat, Fletcher Pickles, is a registered emotional therapy animal for co-owner Travis Barnes, a combat-disabled veteran. Fletcher Pickles caught a few mice as a kitten, but retired early. ""As far as we know, there aren't mice in here to catch,"" says marketing manager Katie Breden. ""He's chased around a few birds, but mostly he's our little mascot."" When people come in to have a cocktail at Hotel Tango, it can be a thinly veiled excuse to see Fletcher Pickles — whose main jobs as a distillery cat appear to be ""look cute while sleeping"" and ""have astronomically large paws"" thanks to some bobcat lineage. He was also born without a tail. Though he may not be next in line for a Guinness world record, this hasn't diminished his place in the distillery. ""He's really special to all of us here,"" Breden says fondly. ""He's just our little guy."" Profiles in Courage of the World's Most Spirited Mousers by Brad Thomas Parsons Hardcover, 104 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? These cats often make up a vast portion of distillery social media pages. ""Anyone can post a picture of their cat in their house,"" says Rick Sicari, co-owner of Albany Distilling in New York. But when the distillery posts a picture of its orange tabby, Cooper, lounging across a barrel or looking like he's ready to drive a forklift, the Internet does a collective ""Awww."" For businesses that don't serve food or drink, having a cat around usually isn't a health code violation (though some of these kitties live in a dubious legal limbo). Cooper, and his new friend Montgomery, have free rein of the distillery. ""Any box that is too small for them — they will find a way to dive into it,"" Sicari says. Most distillery cats are adopted from local shelters, thanks to the fact that once-feral cats that may not fare well in a home environment are perfectly suited to the rigors of hunting mice. And there are plenty of shelter cats looking for homes. Yet some distillery cats simply appear at the right place at the right time.

 Brewster the Brewery Cat, of The Guardian Brewing Co. in Muncie, Ind., is a husky, middle-aged, orange Creamsicle–colored feline who enjoys tuna and sleeping in cardboard boxes. Pennsylvania's 2SP Brewing Co. was ""putting out feelers"" for a cat when one simply showed up, says Joe Ruthig, brewery facilities manager. Brewery Cat, as the severely cross-eyed lady is affectionately named, has turned out to be surprisingly adept at catching rodents, though birds and flies continue to escape her grasp. But Brewery Cat has done such a commendable job with the rodents that she now hunts the area around the brewery as well, Ruthig says. ""The exterminator is like, 'I don't know why I even come here.'"" Traditionally there's been only one prerequisite for a distillery cat: must catch rodents. But today, some prospective owners are also looking for a cat with a certain je ne sais quoi — one that can provide a morale boost during a hard day and also be an extra reason for people to visit their favorite booze bottler at the source.

npr,"September 30, 2017","Irma Was Bad News For Iguanas, Good News For Mosquitoes"," Editor's note: The original version of this story said that the iguanas on the U.S. Virgin Islands feed on mosquitoes and that Hurricane Irma decimated the iguana population, which would most likely result in a proliferation of mosquitoes. In fact, iguanas do not feed on mosquitoes and there is no correlation between their reduced number and the mosquito population. We have updated this story. More than two weeks after Irma hit St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands, you can still see how the winds ripped through tin roofs like lids of sardine cans, snapped electricity poles as if they were toothpicks, upended trucks and planes on the airport tarmac. At a nearby marina, a yacht's bow still sticks out of the water. The strong winds also uprooted trees, cracking their branches and defoliating them to the bare bone. St. Thomas is no longer a lush green rain forest. Instead, it's dull brown with naked trees on the hillsides. For the thousands of iguanas, this massive destruction of their vegetation is tragic. The tree canopies where they live and hide are all gone. They can't camouflage themselves anymore. The fruit, leaves and hibiscus flowers have disappeared. Since Hurricanes Irma and Maria, there's also been a lot of rain in the region. That's promising for trees and fruit to grow back so iguanas can hide and eat. But the rains also mean more mosquitoes. ""The debris and receding floodwaters are excellent breeding sites for disease-carrying mosquitoes,"" says Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine. That's a boon for diseases like dengue, chikungunya and Zika. ""Without healthy populations of insect-eating bats, lizards, frogs and birds, our human populations are more vulnerable,"" says U.S. Virgin Islands wildlife biologist Renata Platenberg. She adds that these species are a part of a critical ecosystem that ultimately benefits humans on the island. Iguanas are not a native to the island, but nonetheless they are part of the wildlife that plays a major role in the food chain. They eat fruit that also attracts insects. They've made the Virgin Islands their home because the climate and vegetation had been, until now, just right. Despite the role these hungry lizards play in the overall ecosystem, islanders either love them or hate them. Love them because they're tame, social reptiles. They don't bite — unless provoked, of course. Their prehistoric look offers great photo ops for tourists. And they're hated by locals mainly because they eat home gardens and poop on people's properties. The iguanas might be able to swim to their neighboring island of St. John, but they'll find the forests are all gone there, too. ""All the islands in the same proximity are all devastated,"" says iguana lover Laural Branick, a park ranger at Virgin Islands National Park. ""There's nothing for them to eat."" With the amount of deforestation caused by this year's hurricanes, it could take a long time for the trees to come back. So for the moment, the green lizards are easy to spot, perched on broken branches, running aimlessly across streets — and sometimes getting hit by cars. ""We should just eat them,"" says St. Thomas native Brigitte Berry. ""They're delicious."" A previous version of this post said that iguanas feast on mosquitoes, helping to control the mosquito population. In fact, iguanas do not eat mosquitoes.

npr,"September 29, 2017","Animals, Plants Rafted  Across The Pacific After Japan's 2011 Earthquake"," A new study has just been published in the journal Science. It documents the voyage of nearly 300 Japanese marine coastal organisms. And to talk about these creatures, we're joined now by one of the study's authors, Greg Ruiz. He's at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center. Welcome. GREG RUIZ: Thank you. CHANG: Tell me what's new in this paper. RUIZ: What's really new and surprising in this study is that we documented a wide-scale mega-rafting event where coastal organisms were able to hitch a ride on debris items that were swept offshore from Japan and transmitted across the entire Pacific Ocean. And the remarkable thing about this is that these coastal organisms are not known to do this broad-scale trans-ocean dispersal. And to our knowledge, this is really the first documentation of this large-scale transport event for coastal organisms in open ocean. CHANG: So what do these organisms look like? Can you just describe them for me real quick? RUIZ: Sure. It's a wide range of - actually spectacular range of organisms from coastal habitats, the ones that we know and love - barnacles, crabs, sea stars. And the remarkable thing is the large number - the community of organisms across a wide spectrum of organism types. We also found organisms that probably wouldn't be recognized so commonly, things that are quite bizarre. CHANG: What do they look like? RUIZ: Some of them are like small sea anemones, but they live inside of muscles - on the gills of muscles. CHANG: With all these huge storms that have been happening lately, will we be seeing more of this kind of thing - debris carrying lifeforms to distant lands? RUIZ: Yes. We think that that's one of the take-home messages of the study - that certainly marine organisms have been able to be raft in an open ocean in the past but usually with rafting on things like logs, different types of debris that would essentially dissolve under them, whereas now what is washed offshore are plastic items, fiberglass, things that persist for a really long time. CHANG: Right. RUIZ: And so suddenly there's an opportunity for those organisms to not only colonize but to ride those rafts to great distances that were not possible historically. CHANG: Four years ago, a Japanese dock that was encrusted with life - it washed onto an Oregon beach. And I was struck by the headline we gave it on npr.org. ""Is Japanese Dock A Noah's Ark Or A Trojan Horse?"" I want to ask you. Is this phenomenon a good thing or a bad thing - when new species get introduced to new places? RUIZ: Well, the phenomenon is what we refer to as biological invasions - when species are introduced to a region where they were not previously present. CHANG: Invasion sounds like a bad word. RUIZ: Well, it has that connotation, but we don't mean it as a bad word necessarily. It's how islands are colonized from mainland species rafting across the ocean or by dispersal and other ways. But the thing that's happened in modern time is that the rate and the magnitude, the scale of those transfer events has increased. And so what we see in this case is that a new mechanism has come into play. We don't know whether those species have actually colonized on the West Coast of North America. We believe that there is a very good chance that some of them have. And we don't really have a good sense of what the possible consequences may be. CHANG: That's Greg Ruiz of the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center. Thank you very much for speaking with us. RUIZ: Great, thanks very much. Copyright © 2017 NPR.  All rights reserved.

npr,"September 26, 2017",Guggenheim Pulls Animal Art From Upcoming Chinese Exhibition," Late last night, the Guggenheim Museum in New York announced it was pulling three works from an upcoming show of contemporary art from China. One is a large screen-covered box with live lizards and insects inside. The other two are videos of animals. The museum's decision came after pressure from animal rights activists. Rick Karr has more. RICK KARR, BYLINE: Curators had selected around 150 pieces for the Guggenheim's upcoming show ""Art And China After 1989: Theater Of The World."" One of them was a video of a performance the artists Sun Yuan and Peng Yu staged at a Beijing museum in 2003 titled ""Dogs That Cannot Touch Each Other."" (SOUNDBITE OF DOGS BARKING) KARR: Online footage of the performance shows pairs of dogs facing each other harnessed to stationary treadmills and encouraged to run at each other. Ben Williamson of the group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, which demanded the piece be pulled from the show, says neither it nor the other two works deserve to be called art. BEN WILLIAMSON: They are essentially acts of cruelty to animals masked as creativity. PETA objects to the use of all animals in art. This should by now be a no-brainer. KARR: An online petition calling for the removal of the three works drew more than half a million signatures. The Guggenheim announced it was pulling the pieces from the show because it had received, quote, ""explicit and repeated threats of violence."" A Guggenheim spokesperson says the museum made the NYPD aware of the threats. But PETA's Ben Williamson is unsympathetic. WILLIAMSON: If anyone has said something harsh or threatening to the museum, it's really an indictment of the museum that they didn't change due to rational discourse and peaceful public appeals in the first place. KARR: But Suzanne Nossel of the human rights group PEN America says the circumstances surrounding the withdrawal of the pieces should give animal rights activists and everyone else pause. SUZANNE NOSSEL: Next time, people who object to art feel, OK, we're not going to be satisfied until this work gets pulled. And I think that is a worrisome development because you can imagine all kinds of controversy sparking that kind of intense protest. KARR: The remaining pieces in ""Art In China After 1989: Theater Of The World"" will go on display next week. For NPR News, I'm Rick Karr in New York.

npr,"September 24, 2017","Lost In The Storm, He Found A Place In My Family"," Earlier this month, when I was in Miami reporting on Hurricane Irma, I visited the Miami-Dade animal shelter. In the chaos after the storm, with downed power lines and flooding, dogs were being dropped off. Some were lost or strays or they had been abandoned by their owners. The people dropping them off spotted them wandering alone in the city. One particular puppy caught my eye: a tiny 3-month-old Jack Russell mix with big brown eyes, black and brown spots and tufted hair. He'd been found in a park after the storm. He was slightly bedraggled and he'd clearly spent the hurricane alone in the rain and wind. He had no chip or collar. He licked my nose and it was love. I texted my husband. His answer was succinct: ""Oh no."" My answer was an unequivocal ""oh yes."" This puppy was going to be mine. But first, I had to wait to see if anyone claimed him. No one did. So last week, I flew back down to Miami to pick him up. Lilian Bohorquez works for Miami-Dade County Animal Services and she'd been taking care of the puppy in her office. She told me everybody loved him, that he loved to play and lick. And then she filled me in on some of his less endearing antics, like peeing in the director's office and chewing computer cables. Credit:  Lulu Navarro But it didn't matter when I finally saw his little face. I scooped him up and cuddled him like a baby. Now, I am obviously a dog lover. But rescue dogs in particular have played an important role in my life. When I was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder during the Iraq War, I adopted my first rescue. Pets have a valuable role to play in the recovery from trauma. Her name was Ursa, and until the day she died of cancer a few years ago, she was one of the most important parts of my life. We have another rescue called Nena — who is wonderful — but she's older, and has trouble keeping up now with my 4-year-old daughter. This puppy who had been abandoned in a storm I had covered in my hometown seemed like it was destined to be mine. While down there, I got a quick update from Alex Munoz, the director of Miami-Dade County Animal Services. Fewer people are adopting pets there, he says, because after the storm many folks are still struggling with no power and property damage. Many animals were moved out to other parts of the country; the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and private companies pitched in to help. Munoz says Irma has changed their thinking on one important issue. After Hurricane Katrina, a federal law allowed shelters to admit people with pets. But during Irma, there was only one pet-friendly shelter available and it was at capacity — which meant people refused to evacuate certain high-risk areas. ""Something that we've learned, and we've seen firsthand, is unless folks have an option to go with their pets, they are not going to go,"" Munoz says. Florida and other areas prone to natural disasters need to expand the number of pet-friendly facilities, he says. Credit:  Lulu Navarro  Paperwork all done, my puppy was ready to go. The team at Miami-Dade said their goodbyes to me and my dog and we flew home to D.C.

 NPR's Lulu Garcia-Navarro says rescue dogs have helped her in recovering from PTSD. I had not told my daughter about my mission. I arrived just before bedtime; she was in the living room playing when the puppy and I walked through the door. ""Oh Mommy!"" she cried in a voice that melts a mother's heart. ""I love him, I love him,"" she chanted as she hugged and kissed him. I had a few terrible ideas on what to name him — Irmo, after the storm, Mr. Bubbles, because I thought it was funny, Stormy, which is self-explanatory. We finally settled on Kiko. He's been making himself at home. Yes, he's rambunctious and has peed on a few carpets and chewed a few cables. My daughter, my husband and I adore him though. Kiko sleeps with us every night, and he cries at the window when my daughter heads to school. Kiko was lost in the storm, but he will have a home forever with us.

By Tuesday, there were 200. And on Wednesday after classes got out, they decided to lock down the school. MCEVERS: Custodians looked for gaps and leaks and relocated the bats. Here's district spokesman Jason Olsen. JASON OLSEN: They catch the bats by just using nets almost like a butterfly net. And the bats actually are fairly tame. They don't come diving at you or anything else. They actually try to get out of your way most of the time. CHANG: Turns out bats aren't a new problem for West High School. The school was built on a bat migratory path. OLSEN: This goes on every year about this time when the weather gets colder. We've had quite a few jokes about, you know, seeing if they could come a little bit later and - just in time for Halloween and decorations there. But we don't really control that timing. CHANG: One more missed opportunity - the school's sports teams are not called the Bats. MCEVERS: The West High School Panthers were back in class as usual on Thursday. Copyright © 2017 NPR.

npr,"October 20, 2017","To Reduce Risk Of Recurring Bladder Infection, Try Drinking More Water"," Urinary tract infections cause painful urination and are unfortunately widespread. Scientists estimate that somewhere between 40 percent to more than 50 percent of women will get a UTI in their lifetime, and one in four will get a repeat infection. Left untreated, they can lead to kidney problems. Cranberry juice is a common at-home preventative measure, but the science behind relying on the bitter fruit is pretty mixed. Some research has shown evidence that compounds in cranberries could help prevent bacteria from infecting the urinary tract lining, but other studies concluded that the juice didn't help people with recurring bladder infections. But, there may be a simple, old, and drug-free way to reduce these infections: Drink more water — a lot more water. A study presented at IDWeek earlier this month in San Diego, an annual meeting of infectious disease professionals, suggests that drinking more water is pretty effective at reducing bladder infections in women who are prone to them. And it also resulted in doctors issuing 47 percent fewer prescriptions for antibiotics in these women. The research was funded by Danone Research. Danone also sells bottled water, like Evian, but Dr. Thomas Hooton, the lead author of the study and the clinical director of the Division of Infectious Diseases at the University of Miami, says that the study's conclusions are not exclusive to Danone's water. The study specifically looked at 140 premenopausal women in Bulgaria with recurring urinary tract infections, defined as more than three in the previous year, who drank less than a liter and a half of water (about six cups) each day. For an entire year, half the participants upped their daily water intake by one and a half liters, while the other half didn't change their water intake. The women who drank more water cut their UTI rates nearly in half — getting an average of 1.6 infections versus the control group's 3.1 infections. The research has not yet been submitted for publication. The idea of drinking more water to prevent UTIs doesn't come as a shock to doctors — it's common advice. Dr. Anthony Schaeffer, a Northwestern University urology professor not involved in the research says the study puts what doctors have known into scientific terms. He adds, ""What's nice about the study is that it demonstrates something that sounds logical to be true."" Urinary tract infections occur when bacteria sneaks into the bladder from the urethra. Women have shorter urethras than men, making it easier for bacteria to get in the bladder and putting women at increased risk for infection. Hooton says although it's simplistic, drinking a lot of water helps flush out the bacteria that can cause an infection. ""You're basically clearing bacteria out of the bladder,"" he explains, as well as reducing the concentration of bacteria in the urine. These two effects reduce the ability of the bacteria to stick to bladder cells, which is thought to cause infection, he adds. If you end up with a urinary tract infection despite adding water and maybe cranberry juice to your diet, antibiotics can usually treat it. But the World Health Organization has warned that some types of bacteria commonly causing these infections is becoming resistant to antibiotics. The more you take antibiotics, the more likely bacteria in your body will become resistant to those drugs. It's not uncommon to get UTIs multiple times, so the issue of antibiotic resistance is especially risky with this kind of infection.  Last year, U.S. scientists found a UTI-causing germ in a Pennsylvania woman that didn't respond to an antibiotic commonly used as a last resort. So, how much water should you drink to ward off urinary tract infections? Hooton says because they only looked at a 1.5 liter increase, he can't say exactly. And while ""it seems likely that any increase in hydration would have a beneficial effect"" for everyone, Hooton says, the study specifically focuses on women who get three or more urinary tract infections a year. ""On the other hand, we see no downside to advising more fluid intake in healthy women with UTI recurrences, and we would certainly want to advise them to drink more fluids in our counseling to try this as well as other things to avoid antimicrobials,"" he tells Shots in an email.

npr,"October 20, 2017","Bad-Mouthing Opponents Likely Spurs Them On To Win, Research Shows"," Now we have some trash talk. Bad-mouthing opponents - you know, like in a competition. Researchers have asked this question - if you trash-talk your opponent, does it affect their behavior? Let's try to find out by asking NPR's social science correspondent, Shankar Vedantam. Hi, Shankar. SHANKAR VEDANTAM, BYLINE: Hi, Steve. INSKEEP: Social science, huh? VEDANTAM: (Laughter). INSKEEP: Is that, like, where a bunch of scientists have a party? What is that? VEDANTAM: I just think NPR hosts are not very good at trash-talking, Steve. They're just too nice. INSKEEP: No, no, maybe not. I suppose not. Loser. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). INSKEEP: Anyway, go on. VEDANTAM: (Laughter) Trash-talking comes in two flavors, Steve. One is what you might call friendly and humorous. I'm thinking about an example from the business world. The CEO of T-Mobile once said, I saw more honesty on a match.com ad than AT&amp;T;'s coverage maps. INSKEEP: Brutal business rivalry takedown. OK. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). But, sometimes, trash-talking also has a sharper edge to it, Steve. I was talking to Jeremy Yip. He's at Georgetown University. He told me that, sometimes, the most polite people on the planet can suddenly turn foulmouthed. JEREMY YIP: I grew up in Canada. And Canadians are known for being very polite and adhering to social norms of civility. What I noticed was that when Canadians go into a hockey game, all of a sudden, all that civility goes out the window. INSKEEP: (Laughter) I can imagine that. All right. VEDANTAM: Now, of course, the master of malicious trash talk in our current day, Steve, is Donald Trump. You know, he's called former presidential candidate Jeb Bush low-energy Jeb. He's called North Korean leader Kim Jong Un little rocket man. INSKEEP: Little Bob Corker the other day... VEDANTAM: That's right. INSKEEP: ...Referring to the Tennessee senator. VEDANTAM: Former FBI director is a showboat. And here he is on another opponent, former Texas Governor Rick Perry. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: He put glasses on so people will think he's smart. And it just doesn't work. INSKEEP: OK. So it's a memorable line. It seemed to work for him politically. But what is the effect on the individual that you're targeting this way? VEDANTAM: Here's where the research gets interesting, Steve. Along with Maurice Schweitzer and Samir Nurmohamed, Jeremy Yip has conducted a series of experiments. And he finds that trash-talking usually doesn't diminish your opponents. It boosts them. People compete harder, and they become more motivated to defeat you. YIP: The mechanism here is rivalry. So when we're targets of trash-talking, we're more likely to perceive our opponents as rivals. And this increases the psychological stakes such that we become more motivated to perform better. INSKEEP: People in sports know this. If you're about to play the New York Yankees, and you call them a bunch of overpaid bums, they're going to take that quote and put it up in the clubhouse. VEDANTAM: That's exactly right. And, in fact, Yip and his colleagues find that when you trash-talk someone, they, in fact, become less interested in winning and more interested in just defeating you. In other words, people are willing to go down if they can take you with them. The researchers also find a very important boundary condition, Steve. Trash talk seems to boost performance in competitive settings. But it seems to undermine creativity. So... INSKEEP: Undermine creativity. VEDANTAM: That's right. So if you're a coach who wants to use trash talk as a motivator, be careful about when and how you use it. INSKEEP: Oh, because it just gets you so mad, you might compete harder. But it's hard for you, really, to think or find new ways to do things. VEDANTAM: That's exactly right. And maybe this is why Donald Trump was affected when it came to political combat. When he trash-talked his opponents, it made them angry but not more creative in being able to come back at him with another one-liner. INSKEEP: That's NPR's Shankar Vedantam, our social science correspondent, who's excellent, of course, and also the host of the podcast that explores the unseen patterns in human behavior. It's called Hidden Brain. (SOUNDBITE OF RAPPER BIG POOH'S ""TOO REAL (INSTRUMENTAL)"") Copyright © 2017 NPR.  All rights reserved.

npr,"October 17, 2017","Search Of DNA In Dogs, Mice And People Finds 4 Genes Linked To OCD"," People who have obsessive-compulsive disorder can get trapped inside a thought. It repeats itself, like a stuck song. Did I lock the door? Is that doorknob clean enough to touch? I better wash my hands again — and again. The biology underpinning this loop remains murky to scientists, but scientists are beginning to sniff out potential genetic factors behind OCD and shed light on how the disorder affects the brain. Research published Tuesday in Nature Communications identifies four genes with the strongest links to OCD to date. ""There had been a few studies that looked for genes associated with OCD, and they found some interesting ones, but they were never able to achieve statistical significance,"" says Elinor Karlsson, a senior author on the study and a geneticist at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard University. To identify the genes, Karlsson and her collaborators searched three sets of DNA. Two came from dogs and mice that had compulsive tendencies. ""Dogs, it turns out, are surprisingly similar to people,"" Karlsson says. ""They're chasing their own tail or chewing themselves or chasing shadows like normal, but they're doing it for hours. They literally can't stop."" The last set came from humans. The researchers were looking for any genes in dogs and mice that had been tied to compulsive behavior. In humans, they examined genes previously suggested as having a role in OCD or that were linked to autism, which shares some characteristics with OCD. ""We looked at anything that looked interesting,"" Karlsson says. ""It was about 1 out of every 30 genes of all 20,000 total in the genome, and the regulatory regions around them involved when the gene's turned on and off."" In the first cut, the researchers identified 608 genes of interest from all three species. The team then took those genes and compared them in roughly 600 people with OCD and 600 people without. Out of that analysis, just four genes began showing up consistently in people with OCD as having some kind of mutation, says Hyun Ji Noh, a geneticist at the Broad Institute and the lead author on the study. People with mutations in these genes don't necessarily have OCD, though, Karlsson points out. ""OCD is a really complicated disease. All we can say is if you have variations in these genes, you are more likely to have OCD,"" she says. But by identifying these genes, the study helps to paint an early picture of how OCD works in the brain, says Dr. Marco Grados, an OCD researcher at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine who did not work on the study. ""[The study] does confirm some prior findings,"" he says. The genes are active in a specific circuit of the brain, the cortical-striatal loop, which is thought to help control actions. ""Brain imaging has shown hyperactivity in this circuit [in OCD],"" Grados says, and two of the four genes code for proteins that help hold connection points between brain cells or synapses in this circuit together. Mutations in these genes might stop neurons from communicating with one another effectively in this region. Specifically, Grados says they might be breaking down a stop mechanism in the loop. In a brain without OCD, a thought may come up and say, ""Wash your hands."" Once you've actually washed your hands, that stop mechanism would kick in and the thought would end. But in a brain with OCD, Grados says the genes Karlsson and her team identified suggest those brakes have been cut. The thought can't end, and people feel compelled to continue the action. ""That's the speculation,"" Grados says. One gene that the authors found, called REEP3, was a little unexpected, Grados says. This gene seems to be important in learning and forming new connections in the brain, he says. ""OCD and anxiety are kind of like learning disorders,"" he says. ""Often with OCD, people have a fear of germs. You can't touch tables or door knobs and every time it's the same sensation. You didn't learn that the last time you touched a doorknob, nothing happened. It's like touching it for the first time ever."" If there's a mutation in genes like REEP3, Grados says that might start to explain this aspect of OCD. ""We've done a recent study – the results are not completely worked out – but we're finding [learning] genes like this to be the main ones in OCD,"" he says. ""This is kind of novel, but these results make sense. It's confirming some stuff we're suspecting."" Angus Chen is a journalist based in New York City. He is on Twitter: @angRChen.

npr,"October 16, 2017",Sleep Scientist Warns Against Walking Through Life 'In An Underslept State'," ""Human beings are the only species that deliberately deprive themselves of sleep for no apparent gain,"" Walker says. ""Many people walk through their lives in an underslept state, not realizing it."" Walker is the director of the Center for Human Sleep Science at the University of California, Berkeley. He points out that lack of sleep — defined as six hours or fewer — can have serious consequences. Sleep deficiency is associated with problems in concentration, memory and the immune system, and may even shorten life span. ""Every disease that is killing us in developed nations has causal and significant links to a lack of sleep,"" he says. ""So that classic maxim that you may [have] heard that you can sleep when you're dead, it's actually mortally unwise advice from a very serious standpoint."" Walker discusses the importance of sleep — and offers strategies for getting the recommended eight hours — in his new book, Why We Sleep. Interview Highlights On what you should do if you can't sleep You should not actually stay in bed for very long awake, because your brain is this remarkably associative device and it quickly learns that the bed is about being awake. So you should go to another room — a room that's dim. Just read a book — no screens, no phones — and only when you're sleepy return to the bed. And that way your brain relearns the association with your bedroom being about sleep rather than wakefulness. ... Another thing that people can do if you don't want to get up and go to a different room is actually try meditating. ... Being quite a stoic, hard-nosed scientist, I actually didn't really believe the data [about meditation as a sleep aid], even though the data is very strong. And I started doing it myself, particularly when I was traveling with jet lag, and I found it to be very effective. ... Unlocking the Power of Sleep and Dreams by Matthew, Ph.D. Walker Hardcover, 360 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? It just quiets the mind and it dampens down what we call the ""fight or flight"" branch of the nervous system, which is one of the key features of insomnia. And that can really have some efficacious benefits too. So that's another solution if people would choose not to go to a different room. On whether you can make up for a sleep deficit by sleeping longer another day You're trying to sleep off a debt that you've lumbered your brain and body with during the week, and wouldn't it be lovely if sleep worked like that? Sadly it doesn't. Sleep is not like the bank, so you can't accumulate a debt and then try and pay it off at a later point in time. And the reason is this: We know that if I were to deprive you of sleep for an entire night — take away eight hours — and then in the subsequent night I give you all of the sleep that you want, however much you wish to consume, you never get back all that you lost. You will sleep longer, but you will never achieve that full eight-hour repayment, as it were. So the brain has no capacity to get back that lost sleep that you've been lumbering it with during the week in terms of a debt. On letting teenagers sleep on weekends Parents will often pull the covers off their teenager [on] weekends and say, ""It's daylight out! It's noon! You're wasting the day!"" And that's wrong for two reasons. ... It's not their fault; it's their biology that wants them to be asleep at that time. But it's more than that, because it also turns out that they are trying to sleep off a debt that we have actually saddled them with by way of this incessant model of early school start times. We have to abandon that attitude and we also have to change the educational practice as well. On how the quantity and quality of sleep decreases with age  The amount of sleep — the total amount of sleep that you get — starts to decrease the older that we get. I think one of the myths out there is that we simply need less sleep as we age, and that's not true, in fact. We need just as much sleep in our 60s, 70s [and] 80s, as we do when we're in our 40s. It's simply that the brain is not capable of generating that sleep, which it still needs, and the body still needs. So, total amount of sleep actually decreases. We also know that the continuity of sleep also starts to fall apart. Sleep becomes much more fragmented. There are many more awakenings throughout the night — pain, bathroom trips, etc. But we also know that it's not the quantity of sleep that changes with aging, it's also the quality of sleep. It seems to be particularly the deepest stage of sleep — something that we call non-rapid-eye-movement sleep, or non-REM sleep, the very deepest stages of non-REM sleep — those are selectively eroded by the aging process. By the time you're in your 50s, you've perhaps lost almost 40 to 50 percent of that deep sleep you were having, for example, when you were a teenager. By age 70, you may have lost almost 90 percent of that deep sleep. On using sleeping pills, like Ambien, to sleep  Unfortunately the current set or classes of sleeping pills that we have do not produce naturalistic sleep. So they are all a broad set of chemicals that we call the sedative hypnotics, and sedation is not sleep, it's very different. It doesn't give you the restorative natural benefits of sleep. ... If you look at the electrical signature of sleep that you have when you're taking those medications, it's not the same as a normal night of sleep. On how caffeine affects sleep  First, and most obvious for some people, is that it stops you falling asleep. Some people, however, say, ""I can have a cup of coffee after dinner and I fall asleep just fine, so I'm not one of those people that is sensitive to caffeine."" And that's quite dangerous, because we also know that even if you can fall asleep, the depth of the sleep that you have when caffeine is swilling around within the brain is not going to be as deep anymore. So people may wake up the next morning, they'll feel unrefreshed. They'll start to reach for the coffeepot earlier. They'll drink more caffeine, never having realized that it was the cup of coffee last night that has left you feeling underslept, because they didn't wake up during the night, they didn't have problems falling asleep, but caffeine can still have that deleterious impact. On alcohol's effect on sleep  Alcohol ... is a sedative drug, and what you're doing there is simply knocking yourself out. You are removing consciousness quickly from the brain by way of having alcohol, but you're not putting yourself into naturalistic sleep. The other issue is that alcohol will fragment your sleep — it will litter it and punctuate it with many more awakenings throughout the night, so short ... that you tend not to remember them. So, once again, you're not quite aware of how bad your sleep was when you had alcohol in the system. The final aspect of alcohol is that it is very good at blocking your REM sleep, or your dream sleep, which is critical for aspects of mental health within the brain and emotional restitution too. So alcohol [is a] very misunderstood drug when it comes to sleep — not helpful. Read an excerpt of Why We Sleep Heidi Saman and Thea Chaloner produced and edited the audio of this interview.

npr,"October 16, 2017","Studies Skewed By Focus On Well-Off, Educated Brains"," Like most brain imaging studies of children, this one included a disproportionate number of kids who have highly educated parents with relatively high household incomes, the team reported Thursday in the journal Nature Communications. For example, parents of study participants were three times more likely than typical U.S. parents to hold an advanced degree. And participants' family incomes were much more likely to exceed $100,000 a year. So the researchers decided to see whether the results would be different if the sample represented the U.S. population, says Kaja LeWinn, an assistant professor at the University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine. ""We were able to weight that data so it looked more like the U.S."" in terms of race, income, education and other variables, she says. And when the researchers did that, the picture of ""normal"" brain development changed dramatically. For instance, when the sample reflected the U.S. population, children's brains reached several development milestones much earlier. One of these milestones involved the total surface of the brain's cortex, which plays a key role in in memory and thought. The unweighted data showed that this surface area continued to increase until after a child's 12th birthday. The weighted data showed a much earlier peak — before age 10. Unweighted data also showed several areas in the front and back of the brain developing at the same time. But the weighted data showed a different pattern. Areas toward the back of the brain, which do things like process visual information, developed first. Meanwhile areas toward the front of the brain, which are involved in thinking and judgment, developed later. This study doesn't look at what those differences might mean for children's emotional and intellectual development. The key point is rather that researchers should make sure that they're looking at a representative sample when they're defining ""normal."" The idea that the brain tends to develop earlier toward the back and later toward the front is ""more consistent with our broader understanding of brain development,"" LeWinn says. And it is one reason many brain scientists argue that judgment and impulse control are not fully developed until people reach their 20s. The study is a reminder that the brains of children from different backgrounds can develop differently, LeWinn says. ""The brain is really responsive to experience,"" she says. ""That's something we need to pay attention to."" The results also offer a reminder that brain imaging studies tend to attract an atypical group of people. Participants are likely to live near a major university, where the studies are usually conducted, LeWinn says. They are also ""more likely to be white, more likely to be high income, more likely to have more education, and they may have different social networks,"" she says. One reason for these differences is that university-based studies tend to attract people who have ties to the school. ""Many of the studies we use to understand how the brain works included mostly college students,"" she says. It's unrealistic to expect that every brain imaging study sample represents the full range of U.S. residents, Le Winn says. But even small studies should do a better job disclosing the characteristics of people being studied. And larger studies should consider weighting the results to more accurately represent the nation's population, she says. At least one big study is already trying to address the diversity issue. The federally funded Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study is in the process of enrolling 10,000 children ages 9 and 10. Researchers plan to track participants until they become adults using brain imaging as well as information about sleep, attention, substance use, physical activity and sports injuries. And to make sure the participants reflect the U.S. population, researchers are taking steps to enroll children of diverse races and ethnicities, education and income levels, and living environments. The team is doing that by recruiting students from carefully selected schools from 21 sites across the country. ""Our ultimate goal is to recruit a sample that matches the U.S. population,"" says Emily Giron, the ABCD project's communications manager.

npr,"October 29, 2017",Queen Victoria's Unlikely Bond With Indian Attendant Made Curry Classy," They met at breakfast. On the third morning of her Golden Jubilee celebrations in June 1887, a tired Queen Victoria was greeted by a tall, bearded young man in a scarlet tunic and white turban. Victoria was 68, Abdul Karim, 23. As he knelt to kiss her feet, she was struck by what she described in her diary as his ""fine serious countenance."" Some inexplicable connection was made that day, with the queen, who was still grieving the death of her beloved Scottish servant and companion John Brown, deeply drawn to Karim. It was the start of an extraordinary friendship — and the theme of a syrupy new film. Victoria &amp; Abdul is a nostalgic colonial romp redeemed mainly by Judi Dench's stirring performance as an obstinate old lioness, but it shines the spotlight on this highly unconventional relationship that dominated the lonely queen's final years and broke the boundaries of race, class and religion in an era defined by these hierarchies.  Karim had been sent from Agra to London as a ""gift from India,"" to wait at the queen's table.  But Victoria was so taken by the young Muslim man that she asked him to teach her Urdu (then called Hindustani). Within a year, he had gone from being what the English dismissively referred to as the ""kitchen boy"" to the queen's ""Munshi"" (teacher). Over the next 13 years, until the queen's death in 1901, Karim was constantly at her side, even spending a night alone with her in her cottage in the Scottish Highlands, where she and Brown had passed the time together. Karim was viewed as the late Brown's replacement — snidely referred to in the movie as ""the brown John Brown"" — and his closeness to the queen, though her feelings were clearly maternal, scandalized the royal household. But a spicier outcome of this friendship was the elevation of a dish already popular in England: curry. A few weeks after kissing her feet, writes Shrabani Basu in Victoria &amp; Abdul: The True Story of the Queen's Closest Confidant (the book on which the movie is based), Karim cooked Victoria ""a fine Indian meal: chicken curry, daal, and a fragrant pilau."" In a diary entry on Aug. 20, 1887, the queen noted appreciatively: ""Had some excellent curry prepared by one of my Indian servants."" This was scarcely the first time Victoria had tasted curry, a dish which had become popular in England in the late Georgian period, with a variety of curry pastes and powders available in the stores. ""She definitely had curry before Karim,"" says British food historian Annie Gray, who chronicled Victoria's lavish appetite in her book, The Greedy Queen: Eating with Victoria. ""Long before Karim, curry de poulet appeared on the dinner menu at Windsor Castle on December 29, 1847."" The True Story of the Queen's Closest Confidant by Shrabani Basu Paperback, 288 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? But, as Gray points out, the curries Victoria ate in her youth were quite different from the one Karim cooked her. ""Those early curries, which I call Raj or Anglo-Indian curries, were not what we would recognize today,"" she says. ""They used fruit, were heavy on turmeric and galangal, and were creamy and mild. I once cooked a Raj-style curry and it started off with frying cucumber and apple — and I thought, really? But if you take it on its own merit, it's really nice if still slightly bonkers. In any case, in Victorian England, curry was a way to use up leftover meat and vegetables. It was not regarded as a high-class food."" The queen evidently thought otherwise. Soon, curry was being served on a regular basis at her dining table. Victoria's Swiss cook, Gabriel Tschumi, who joined the kitchens as an apprentice in 1898, described how the Indians did everything from scratch, using only halal meat and grinding their own spices: ""For religious reasons, they could not use the meat which came to the kitchen in the ordinary way, and so they killed their own sheep and poultry for the curries. Nor would they use the curry powder in stock in the kitchens, though it was of the best imported kind, so a part of the household had to be given to them for their special use, and there they worked Indian-style, grinding their own curry powder between two large round stones and preparing all their own flavoring and spices."" In the late 1880s, says Gray, curries feature on Victoria's menus twice a week — as a lunch dish (chicken curry) on Sundays and as a dinner dish (fish curry) on Tuesdays. ""Curries were referred to as the 'Indian dish,'"" says Gray. ""There were two high-ranking tables – the household table and the queen's table. The 'Indian dish' would only appear on the queen's table."" Tschumi claimed it was served ""each day at luncheon whether the guests partook of it or not,"" but Gray disputes this, pointing out that the surviving ledgers make no mention of curry for lunch every day. Indeed, there's no real evidence of Victoria actually relishing it. The only time curry pops up in her diary is on that very first occasion when Karim makes it for her. ""She never mentions it again,"" says Gray, who strongly suspects that this legendary curry wasn't even cooked by Karim, but by the Indian cook whom he and the other four Indian servants had employed to cook for them. ""There are all these myths about Victoria eating curry every day and for breakfast, which is just not true,"" says Gray. ""Her breakfast was mutton chops, sausages and a beef steak. She had a sweet tooth, a taste for whiskey (once adding it to her claret), and a lifelong penchant for Brussels biscuits (a kind of rusk) and fresh fruit. Her physician, Dr. Reid, was forever advising her to eat less and take digestion salts to deal with her stomach upsets and flatulence, but no, though she ordered curry to be cooked, she didn't eat it every day."" As curries simmered in the royal kitchens, so did the royal household, which watched with growing resentment as the lowborn Indian servant continued to bask in the queen's favor, receive land grants, promotions and honors, and walk around with a sword and a chest of medals. ""He had reduced the household to a level of abject jealousy,"" says Gray. Everyone, including the Indian servants, found him pompous, grasping, and conceited. But the queen wouldn't hear a word against him. She dismissed all complaints as ""race prejudice"" and was furious when she found out that her Indian servants were being called ""the Black Brigade."" In her eyes, the ""gentle and understanding"" Karim was the one sinned against. In the teeth of all opposition — including from Dr. Reid and her son and heir Edward — she robustly defended the ""unfortunate persecuted Munshi."" Through the plotting and intrigue, the queen carried on with her Urdu lessons. A quick learner, she filled her little red and gold phrase book with everyday Urdu phrases, including two peevish complaints about her meals: Cha Osborne mein hamesha kharab hai (The tea is always bad at Osborne) and Unda thik ubla nahin hai (The egg is not properly boiled.) Karim, whose English had greatly improved, regaled her with spangled stories of the Taj Mahal, the street bazaars of Agra, and the way in which religious festivals were celebrated in his homeland. Victoria had been proclaimed Empress of India in 1876, but had never visited the country. For the gourmand queen, tasting an Indian mango soon became an idée fixe. The mango scene in the film, says Basu, is based on fact. Victoria did indeed order a mango from India, despite Karim warning her it wouldn't survive the six-week sea voyage. Sure enough, when it arrives and is presented by a footman, the overripe orb is peremptorily declared to be ""off."" ""Victoria was an adventurous eater,"" says Gray, ""She ate anything – Indian, Chinese (she loved the bird's nest soup), new fruits, curry. My grandmother, for instance, thought curry was this funny foreign stuff, she wouldn't eat it. Victoria, living a hundred years ago, did. I don't think she popularized curry per se, it was already so popular, but her embracing of Indian culture, including its food, helped make it ahead of its time."" By her Diamond Jubilee in 1897, the queen was deep in the throes of what her exasperated doctor called ""Munshi mania."" She was implacable — even the news that he had gonorrhea did nothing to dent her affection for him. But as Victoria's reign drew to a close, so did Karim's. Barely hours after the queen's funeral, the new monarch, Edward VII, evicted the Munshi and ordered he be deported to India. ""The new king did not want to see any more turbans in the palaces or smell the curries from the Royal kitchens,"" writes Basu. It was too late of course. Curry has insinuated itself into the English palace and palate. The Swiss chef who wrote about the Indian servants grinding masalas would later note that under Edward VII, curry and rice were cooked regularly by non-Indian cooks, and that George V, Edward's curryholic son and Victoria's grandson, insisted on curry every single day.

npr,"October 29, 2017",An American Comic In Canada," ERIK GRIFFIN: It's good to be here, guys, up here in Canada because, man, it's sensitive as [expletive] down in the United States. I need to be able to make jokes about women and you guys not be like, oh, here we go. Here we go. (LAUGHTER) GRIFFIN: Trump's America. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Erik Griffin starred on Comedy Central's ""Workaholics."" And he was at Yuk Yuk's Comedy Club after weeks of touring the U.S. We caught up with him in a dingy green room. Griffin had sunk into a low couch. And he was clearly worn out. GRIFFIN: I mean, I think being abroad is actually better than being in the United States right now. You know, it's just comedy - I think there's an attack on comedy. It's like people forgot what it really is. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So when you come to a place like Canada, which historically had a good relationship, like, how do you - do you feel like you have to kind of be an ambassador for America or, like, kind of... GRIFFIN: No. GARCIA-NAVARRO: ...Refer to it in some way? 'Cause I figure... GRIFFIN: Do I feel like I have to defend the United States? No. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Not defend - or explain it or, like, make a joke out of it. Or... GRIFFIN: Well, I mean, that's what we - that's what a comedian does anyway. We're just making light of things that are going on. Or we're pointing out an injustice and trying to make it funny. Or we're trying to ultimately entertain. But, you know, sometimes, some comics - you know, they want to be social justice warriors. I don't ever feel like I have to 'cause I'm already multiracial, multiethnic as it is anyway? GARCIA-NAVARRO: What is your background? GRIFFIN: Well, I'm just mixed. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Yeah. GRIFFIN: You know, I think people want to know what you are, so they know how to hate you, you know? GARCIA-NAVARRO: Fair enough. GRIFFIN: So they can put you in a box and say, oh, you can say this, or you can't say this. And I don't subscribe to that. So... GARCIA-NAVARRO: OK. GRIFFIN: ...I'm racially ambiguous. GARCIA-NAVARRO: It's my first time being outside of the United States since the election. And the question I most frequently get asked is, what is happening down there? GRIFFIN: Yeah, yeah. I know. I think they feel like we have to answer for the choice that we made. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Does it get a laugh overseas? GRIFFIN: I mean, I used to have a lot of jokes about the election pre-election. But once he got in office - and then it just made people uncomfortable. Like, I felt like people were like, this is too real. You know, even I - look, I have not been having a good time on my last three weeks of doing comedy in the United States. I was in Tennessee. I was in St. Louis. And it's just, like, liberals are too sensitive, and conservatives are too angry. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So where do you find comedy then? GRIFFIN: I know. You tell me. That's exactly the problem. GARCIA-NAVARRO: I'm not the comic (laughter). GRIFFIN: I know but that's exactly the dilemma I think a lot of comics are facing right now. It's, like, when things are even-keeled, then you can be edgy. But we're closer to that stuff. So it makes people a little bit more sensitive, a little bit more heightened. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So what happened in places when you were, like, in these places that you said you had a rough time? GRIFFIN: Well, it's because, like, if you're not on the side of the liberal warriors, then people are going to be like, oh, well, this means you hate women. This means that, you know, he hates blacks. He hates Mexicans. He hates Jews. He hates gays. You know, and then you have, like - I'm at a club. And I'll say, hey, where are the Trump supporters? And if I say anything bad about Trump, then they're just, like, you know, cursing at me. And people are walking out. And I got - you won (laughter). Your guy's in office. Why are you storming out? I feel like if I handed out a paper before every show, and I said, tell me what you want me to talk about, it would be nothing on there. But it's just I've got to say, sometimes, it's not fun anymore. GARCIA-NAVARRO: That was comedian Erik Griffin. Copyright © 2017 NPR.  All rights reserved.

But, some things can't be — a family photo album, a scrapbook, grandma's quilt. That's what people in Houston are dealing with as they try to put their lives back together after Hurricane Harvey. And now, a small team of experts from places like the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Small Business Administration and the Smithsonian are trying to help. Teddy Reeves is one of a group of experts at tables inside a former Goodwill store in Beaumont, Texas. He's normally a curator at the National Museum of African American History and Culture in D.C., but here he's part of the joint Smithsonian and FEMA Heritage Emergency National Task Force.

 Task force members like Laura Manaker have helped save photos, family Bibles and collectible prints. He's showing nurse Rebecca Collins how to salvage water damaged family photos by using an aluminum foil turkey pan, a paint brush, and distilled water. Collins is wearing her scrubs, and stopped at the recovery center for assistance, before going back to work at the hospital. Along with photos, she wants to save her academic materials. ""Pictures, documents, also certificates,"" she says. ""You know, like your diploma. And then, of course, I want my nursing books. Because it's very important."" This program was launched last year, in the wake of the devastating flooding in Louisiana. Experts were also sent to South Carolina, following Hurricane Matthew. ""We want to say we can salvage your grandmother's quilt,"" Reeves says. ""We can help you salvage those photos from your high school graduation. Your high school diploma. We had someone who came in with a generational Bible that was passed down in their family. We can help you salvage those things."" That is, if you kept them. Diane Tinsley says she didn't know they could be salvaged. ""When I went over there to wait for the line, I started crying, thinking of all the pictures I had just thrown in the trash,"" she says. Tinsley also threw away her thick family Bible, and most of her 357 record albums. ""I should have researched it. But at the time, you're not thinking. I mean, I walked around in a daze. You know, you're just not thinking. You want that out of your house. And so you just start throwing everything away."" Today, she's asking Laura Manaker, normally at the National Portrait Gallery in D.C., how to save her flood damaged collectable prints. ""They all are stuck together, you know,"" she says. ""There's probably about 35, 40 prints maybe."" [W]e're trying to let people know that all is not lost. You don't have to throw out everything. Laura Manaker For some items, it may be a relatively simple fix. Manaker tells her to put small weights on the corners of each print to prevent curling. But saving other things might be more trouble than it's worth. ""There are things that you might not be able to save,"" Manaker says. ""But we're trying to let people know that all is not lost. You don't have to throw out everything."" FEMA and the Smithsonian say they're considering sending teams to Florida, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, but so far, the logistics are too complicated — and right now people in Puerto Rico are more focused getting their basic needs met.

Chasing Light shares 150 candid shots (many of which were previously unseen) of the first family by Amanda Lucidon, who worked as the only female White House photographer during the final four years of the Obama administration.  As an independent photographer in Washington, D.C., she was surprised to be tapped for the job in the first place.

 Amanda Lucidon On Michelle Obama's personality I think she's one of the most genuine and compassionate and thoughtful people. She has a way of just making everyone feel so comfortable and special and loved. I mean, you think about meeting the first lady, and I know I think about the first time I met her, I was like, 'Oh my gosh, I can't even speak. She's so wonderful, and she's so tall, and she's so pretty, and I don't even know what I'm saying right now,"" you know? So a lot of people have that experience where they meet her for the first time and they're laughing, or crying, or they can't speak. She just has this way of just calming everything right down, and just making people feel loved. Just to see her invite so many people in the White House that didn't think they belong there (myself included, you know?) and be able to give that experience to them, and then allow them to see the light inside themselves — I mean, that was just amazing, every single day, to witness that. On the reason for creating the book For me, my time at the White House – four years – it just went by so quickly. So this was a great way for me to go back in time and look through this visual diary and say, 'Wow, we did so much.' That's when we met those amazing girls from Let Girls Learn, and we got to go to all those wonderful countries. So for me it was a great way to reflect on what we had all experienced together, and the lessons that I learned through that time. ...  I think the biggest lesson that I draw on every day that Mrs. Obama taught me was to look on our challenges that we experience in life as our strengths, and not our weaknesses. You know, when we sort of embrace that, we can see the resilience that we built through those experiences. And with resilience, we can really overcome anything.

It's called Not My Job. Brian May left a promising career in science to try his hand at rock 'n' roll. And he did OK. He founded the band Queen with Freddie Mercury, John Deacon and Roger Taylor, making him, as far as we know, the only Ph.D. astrophysicist in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. But he had another enthusiasm, 3-D stereoscopic photography. He's published a new book of pictures of his band so realistic you can practically smell the groupies. (LAUGHTER) SAGAL: Brian May, welcome to WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME. (APPLAUSE) BRIAN MAY: Thank you very much. SAGAL: I spent a good part of yesterday evening with your book of these amazing stereoscopic photos and the great little viewer that comes with them... MAY: Right. SAGAL: ...Enjoying these 3-D pictures of your band and its history and Freddie Mercury and your other friends and musicians. And I have one thing to ask you. How is it that in all the years that you've been in the public eye, your hair has never changed? (LAUGHTER) SAGAL: Did any - nobody ever came to you and said, Brian, you know, now it's the 1990s. We need to cut your hair? Has any... MAY: Yeah, they do it all the time. (LAUGHTER) MAY: I have a good answer for that. But it's probably not repeatable on your program. (LAUGHTER) SAGAL: So there are so many things that are interesting about you. You were, as I said - you were pursuing your doctorate in science when the band started, right? MAY: I was, yeah. In astronomy. In what they now call astrophysics, yeah. And I gave it up. And I thought I was actually doing astrophysics a favor by choosing the other option. SAGAL: Really? MAY: Yeah. And I also thought, you know, there's a window opening here. And if I don't kind of walk through - or a door opening, I should say. And I thought, if I don't walk through right now, that door will never open again. So I went off and, against all the odds, became a rock star for some reason. SAGAL: Yeah. That seemed to have worked out pretty well for you. MAY: It's OK. It's been OK so far. Yeah. SAGAL: It really has. But... PAULA POUNDSTONE: So wait, you're suggesting that you were not a good astrophysicist? MAY: You know, I didn't think I was. POUNDSTONE: What would make a bad astrophysicist? MAY: Well... POUNDSTONE: Like, you weren't looking in the right... (LAUGHTER) MAY: Well, what would make a bad astrophysicist would be, like, not being able to complete your Ph.D., which is what happened. POUNDSTONE: Oh. MAY: And I couldn't please my supervisor. So 30 years later, I found myself with another supervisor. And he liked what I did. So I kind of updated my vision of myself. But I got it after 30 years. POUNDSTONE: Oh, wow. (APPLAUSE) SAGAL: Wait a minute. What I love is that you going in to get your Ph.D. not as young Brian May but as Brian May the guitarist of Queen. MAY: Yeah. SAGAL: I mean, did you - like, your oral exams - did you come in and say, I could answer your questions, or I could just do the riff from ""We Will Rock You."" MAY: Well, you know, they were tough on me. I think they had to be because they couldn't be seen to kind of make it easy for me, you know? And, you know, I got a whole sheaf of stuff that I had to do in order to finish it off. SAGAL: I bet that... LUKE BURBANK: Did they try to work in any Queen stuff during the defense of your dissertation? Like, you may think you're the champion, Mr. May... (LAUGHTER) BURBANK: ...But this panel thinks otherwise. Do they do anything corny like that? SAGAL: Now, this is the amazing thing about this book because in addition to your interest in astrophysics and obviously shredding on the guitar, you are a huge photography nerd. And you were... MAY: Totally. SAGAL: You were always into 3-D photography. MAY: Yeah. SAGAL: I'm just trying to imagine though that - it must have been like the mid-70s in the absolute apogee of, like, the rock 'n' roll lifestyle. And there's the cocaine. And there are the groupies. And there's the liquor. And you're, like, trying to get everybody to hold still so you can take a 3-D photograph. (LAUGHTER) SAGAL: Guys, guys. Come on. MAY: I'm not going to contradict you there. (LAUGHTER) MAY: Should we just move on? SAGAL: All right. I will. (LAUGHTER) POUNDSTONE: Every high school student has the same story, I imagine, on the way to sports events. SAGAL: Yeah. POUNDSTONE: Like, when I played lacrosse in high school, we would bang our sticks on the roof of the bus. MAY: Oh. POUNDSTONE: How this driver tolerated it I'll never know. And we would scream at the top of our lungs the lyrics to, you know, ""We Are The Champions."" MAY: Great. POUNDSTONE: And it was so much fun. SAGAL: Oh, yeah. BURBANK: Did you guys ever win a match? POUNDSTONE: No. (LAUGHTER) MAY: It did you no good whatsoever. BURBANK: What would you sing on the drive back, ""Another One Bites The Dust?"" (LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE) BURBANK: Can I just ask what - like, in the creation of an amazing, iconic song like ""Bohemian Rhapsody,"" did Freddie Mercury write those lyrics? MAY: Absolutely. BURBANK: And, like, what was it like when he says, OK, these are going to be the words to this song? (LAUGHTER) MAY: We had a kind of unwritten law. You know, generally, this song was kind of the province of the writer. And the writer would have the final say. So yeah, we didn't really discuss it. We didn't say, you know, why are you saying that, Freddie? It was just... BURBANK: So no one looked at him when he started singing scaramouche? POUNDSTONE: Right. (LAUGHTER) MAY: You know, we were enjoying ourselves. SAGAL: Can you do the fandango? MAY: I mean, this stuff is really fun to do in the studio. POUNDSTONE: Oh, I bet. MAY: And nobody had ever done it before, you know? SAGAL: Oh, absolutely. I'd never heard anything like that in my life when that song came out. MAY: Well, and you won't again. SAGAL: I know. I know. POUNDSTONE: So you guys just, you know, scaramouche, scarmouche, not even looking at one another? (LAUGHTER) SAGAL: I can imagine. POUNDSTONE: It does sound like fun. SAGAL: Last question - as an astrophysicist, because this is interesting how you both - do both - can you scientific explain how it is that fat bottomed girls make the world go round? (LAUGHTER) MAY: Yeah. I think that's still true. I was just lucky to find out early, you know? (LAUGHTER) SAGAL: Well, Brian May, we can talk to you all day. But we have business to do. We've asked you here to play a game we're calling... BILL KURTIS: Have a peanut buster parfait. SAGAL: You, of course, as we have been discussing, are one of the founders of Queen, one of the iconic rock bands of all time. So we thought we'd ask you three questions about Dairy Queen. (LAUGHTER) MAY: About what? SAGAL: Dairy Queen. You might have come across it in your travels across America. It's a popular ice cream and fast food franchise. MAY: This is the bit I've been looking forward to so much. SAGAL: Oh, you are. (LAUGHTER) SAGAL: Answer two questions about - by the way, I should say that absolute ignorance is always an advantage in this particular game. MAY: Well, you've got it in this case. (LAUGHTER) ADAM BURKE: I'm just picturing the Queen tour bus pull up to a Dairy Queen. (LAUGHTER) SAGAL: It'd be the greatest day of those people's lives. BURKE: Freddie just marching in. Blizzards for the lot of us. (LAUGHTER) SAGAL: All right (laughter). MAY: Can I go home now? SAGAL: This is already going very well. (LAUGHTER) SAGAL: So the question, though, for Bill is who is legendary guitarist and astrophysicist Brian May playing for? KURTIS: Ella Jones of Baltimore, Md. SAGAL: All right. POUNDSTONE: Here we go. SAGAL: Just two right, and we win it all. None right - who cares? Here we go. Dairy Queen has given us so much by way of frozen treats, the Blizzard, the Dilly Bar, the Oreo Brownie Earthquake. But it's also responsible for what other wonderful thing? A, the defibrillator device; B - the band No Doubt, or C avocado toast? (LAUGHTER) MAY: I would say none of the above. But I have no idea. The defibrillator. I'm going for the defibrillator. SAGAL: You could use a defibrillator at any Dairy Queen. But the answer is the band No Doubt... POUNDSTONE: Really? MAY: You're kidding me. SAGAL: ...Because it turns out that Gwen Stefani and two of her band mates met and formed their band at a Dairy Queen in Anaheim, Calif., when they both - all worked there. MAY: I'm on the edge of my seat. (LAUGHTER) SAGAL: But we have other things. There's this Dairy Queen - one of them - in Morehead, Minn. And it's legendary because it still uses all the old recipes. And it was the place where their famous dilly bar treat was invented. Now, the owner there invented a number of other things that corporate never liked - so they didn't catch on nationally - including which of these? Which of these failed Dairy Queen treats? A, the flaming sundae; B, the meat shake... POUNDSTONE: Ew. SAGAL: ...Or C, the heck-of-a-job brownie? (LAUGHTER) MAY: I'm going to go for number one. SAGAL: The flaming sundae. You're right. (SOUNDBITE OF BELL) POUNDSTONE: Wow. SAGAL: He invented a flaming sundae, a sugar cube doused with liquor - set it on fire. Very attractive. So your last question. If you get this right you win, which I'm sure will go well with your CBE. (LAUGHTER) SAGAL: Last question. Dairy Queen has a deep, dark secret - something they would rather that you - none of us - would know. What is it? A, their original name was Dairy Fairy; B, their ice cream isn't actually ice cream or C, the chain is wholly owned by the government of Iran? (LAUGHTER) BURBANK: He's operating at a slight disadvantage having never been to a Dairy Queen. SAGAL: That's true. MAY: I think B. SAGAL: Yes. You're right. (SOUNDBITE OF BELL) SAGAL: It's true that their product - their frozen soft serve cannot be legally called ice cream because it doesn't have enough real cream in it. (LAUGHTER) SAGAL: Bill, how did Brian May do on our quiz? KURTIS: He is a champion. POUNDSTONE: There we go. (APPLAUSE) KURTIS: Two out of three. SAGAL: My friend, Brian May is an astrophysicist, guitar legend and one of the founders of the great rock bands of all time - that would be Queen. His new book, which is completely worth the hours you will spend staring at it - it's of stereoscopic photos he took. It's called ""Queen In 3-D."" It is out now. Brian May, what a joy to talk to you. Thank you so much for... MAY: Thank you all. SAGAL: Brian May. (SOUNDBITE OF QUEEN SONG, ""WE WILL ROCK YOU"") SAGAL: In just a minute, Bill reads our limericks in their original Irish. Call 1-888-WAITWAIT to join us on the air.

npr,"October 28, 2017","In 'Thank You For Your Service,' The Fight Begins After Iraq"," The new movie Thank Your For Your Service is about coming home. Specifically, it's about American soldiers who come home after serving during the ""surge"" in Iraq in 2007. One scene takes place in a therapist's office. Sgt. Adam Schumann and his wife Saskia need help, and the therapist starts listing Schumann's military honors. ""You never told me about those,"" Saskia says. Saskia is the one who insists Schumann get help. The real-life Adam Schumann says, yes she did. ""She's a firecracker, yea,"" he says. ""Even though she's my ex-wife I owe a lot to her, for her looking at me when I came home, and poking me, and going, 'What the f*** is wrong with you?'"" Schumann did three deployments in Iraq. He led a battalion during the surge. He lost friends. He came home traumatized and plagued with guilt. The movie is based on the non-fiction book of the same name by Pulitzer-Prize-winning journalist David Finkel, who covered the war in Iraq for The Washington Post. He spent several months embedded with Schumann's battalion. ""And by every measure of what a soldier should be, [Schumann] was a great soldier,"" Finkel says. In April 2007, Schumann and a group of his soldiers were on a dangerous operation in a village where bombs had been coming from. While they were on the roof of a building, one of his men — Michael Emory — was shot in the head by a sniper. Finkel says Schumann carried Emory — a big guy — down the stairs on his back. ""Emory was bleeding out of his head, and Adam had him on his back, and just because of the angle of things, the blood coming out of Emory's head kept flowing into Adam's mouth as he was gulping for air,"" he says. ""So that was April. When I met and began reporting seriously on Adam six months later, that was October. He was about to come home. One of the problems is that he could not stop tasting Emory's blood."" It was one of the many episodes that haunted Schumann long after he left Iraq. And at the same time he's carrying the burden of those memories, he's also trying to adjust to life back in the U.S. with his wife and two small children. Thank You For Your Service was written and directed by Jason Hall, the Oscar-nominated screenwriter of American Sniper. ""In previous wars these guys came home on slow ships, and it was two months with these guys in the hold talking about their experiences and sort of processing this journey that they'd gone through in war,"" Hall says. ""And now they'll be in the sandbox one day, next day they're cooking pancakes for their family. It's a real quick turnaround."" Adam Schumann experienced that shock. He came very close to taking his own life. ""They take your gun,"" he says. ""They take your uniform — everything you had. And you're left with a couple of medals, some pieces of paper and some photographs. ""And you do feel alone and then you start isolating because you miss these moments with your buddies and your camaraderie. It can be severely lonely in your own mind – [it] is probably the worst place you can be."" The movie reflects the reality many vets face when seeking help from the Department of Veterans Affairs: packed waiting rooms and long wait times to see a therapist. As Schumann puts it in the movie: ""This s*** could give me PTSD."" Director Jason Hall knows these stories might not be fun to watch. But he believes it's important to understand what day-to-day life is like for a lot of Iraqi vets. ""Until we can understand what we're asking them to do and what we've put them through, we're still going to keep sending them off,"" Hall says. Meanwhile, Adam Schumann says he and his buddies depicted in the film are doing well. For a while Schumann worked as a peer counselor at the same rehab center where he was treated for PTSD. ""I kind of felt like a squad leader again, you know?"" he says. ""I had my own room down in the basement. And the guys knew I was there. And they would just come down, knock on the door, and just chat. And one of the guys, he texts me everyday: 'I love you Adam.' I text him back: 'I love you too.' So just that little — I know he's there for me and he knows I'm there for him no matter what. So it's great."" Schumann was very involved in the making of Thank You For Your Service. He has a cameo. And when the filmmakers heard him singing an old marching cadence he learned in basic training, they got Bruce Springsteen to turn it into the movie's theme song. Schumann sings backup.

npr,"October 28, 2017",'The King Is Always Above The People' In More Lands Than One," Hardcover, 256 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? Time and again, writer Daniel Alarcón has found himself on those lists that make other, less fortunate writers gnash their teeth. He's been named one of 37 under the age of 36, 39 under 39, and 20 under 40. Alarcón is 40 now — he was born in Peru, grew up in the suburbs of Birmingham, Ala., and he's got a new collection of short stories called The King is Always Above the People.  He very rarely mentions where the stories are happening, whether city or country. ""It happened with my first collection where somebody wrote me and said, you know, 'You're writing a lot about Lima but ... it sounds like you could be writing about Lahore,' Alarcón says. ""And I feel like there are certain things that are happening in cities across the world that are universal."" On the title of his collection  It refers to an image that surprised me the first time I saw it because the words kind of don't conform at first blush to the image itself, which is of a head of state hanging from a gallows, and a crowd below looking up at his corpse. In this case, it just struck me that there was something mysterious in that phrase and there was something — an idea about patriarchy and about authority that a character had to grapple with. On the title story  Well, the story's really about a young man who moves to the capital, sort of in search of his dreams, and his dreams include getting out of town, going to the big city, seeing the world, and he's in some ways leaving this kind of stultifying, small town where he was raised and his parents, his father in particular, had lived in the city previously — just long enough to make enough money to go back home, and in that year that his father had lived in the city, he'd been witness to a revolution, which had not excited him in the least. His father had been, you know, very conservative, and when this young man makes it to a city, he's living near the port, working at a store near the port, and they happened to sell these postcards that have this image. In the story, it's a photograph of the dictator being hanged, and the young man, the protagonist of the story, thinks a lot about how this image would shock his father, and it almost has this kind of out-sized power because of that. On placing Abraham Lincoln in present-day Chicago You know, one of the writers I really admire is Mario Bellatin. He lives in Mexico City, and many years ago, I was talking with him about how our current situation in the United States had felt to me so, so reminiscent of the divisions and the polarization that preceded the Civil War. But it seemed to me that the time was right for some kind of historical mashup, and I just wanted to play with this idea of Lincoln as this totemic figure, and sort of bring him to life in a way that was deliberately weird. On his fascination with reinvention, and why it doesn't always end well for his characters I think I end up pretty much the same person most of the day ... but I'm really drawn to reinvention as an idea. I think about my own parents, who moved to the United States in 1980 and the bravery and the courage in something like that. My mom always says ... 'Dani, like, didn't we give you a nice childhood?' I mean, my stories are sometimes not, you know, things don't end well, but you know, no one wants to read about things that end well. Come on, let's be honest. It just seems utterly boring to me. I mean, because the truth is, things don't end well, and if things end well in a story it's only because they'd lopped off the last four chapters, you know? But hopefully as you read and follow these people on those trajectories, you're entertained, or you learn something, or you discover something about yourself that feels true. This story was produced for the radio by Samantha Balaban and Martha Wexler, and adapted for the Web by Sydnee Monday and Petra Mayer.

npr,"October 28, 2017","'People, Places & Things' Is A Clear-Eyed Look At Addiction"," Over the years, many authors have dealt with alcoholism, addiction and recovery — think of plays like Long Day's Journey into Night, or films like Days of Wine and Roses. Now a new play from England joins them: People, Places &amp; Things takes an unsentimental and, at times, harrowing look at addiction and recovery. As it begins, the lights come up in the middle of a scene from Chekhov's The Seagull. The actress playing Nina is woozy and disoriented — clearly high or drunk. Or both. She collapses, and all hell breaks loose onstage — lights flash, loud music plays, actors dressed as EMS workers strip her of her Victorian costume, gurneys whiz by. It's the start of a journey which takes Emma, the actress, on the painful and difficult road towards recovery. ""On paper it sounds like a nightmare at the theater, right? You know, watching an actress who's addicted to drugs trying to get clean and sober,"" says Denise Gough, who plays Emma. ""But actually, it's just a metaphor for a person who wears masks in all her areas and then trying to keep all the masks going."" ""I know people in recovery. I know people with addiction issues,"" says playwright Duncan Macmillan. ""I know people, even in the course of researching and working on this play, several of the people who I was thinking of and talking to about it died."" So, Macmillan says, he didn't want to resort to tired old stereotypes about addicts: ""That they're these tragic people who can only die to serve the narrative. And I was interested in sort of redressing that and trying to find a way to accurately represent and respectfully represent the daily struggle and the daily work of living in recovery."" After her breakdown onstage, Emma checks into a treatment facility — she tells another character she chose it because of its ugliness, to remind her that the world is ""all just purposeless chaos."" The creators of People, Places &amp; Things visited such a place, while doing their research, says director Jeremy Herrin. ""We went down to a place in Catford, in southeast London; a very low-rent recovery center called Freedom, which was completely inspiring. And the stories that we heard and the people that we encountered there were — right, it was absolutely amazing, it was a real privilege."" That's not to say that the characters in People, Places &amp; Things are presented as heroes. Playwright Macmillan shows the ugly side of addiction and recovery, and he wants the audience to constantly be asking questions. ""Who are you? What are we watching? What's true and what's not? Addicts lie, they have to lie. They get really good at it. And actors lie because that's what they're paid to do,"" he says. At the center of the play is the 12-step process. Steps two and three acknowledge the existence of a God who will save you. That's hard for Emma, and it was for Macmillan, too. ""I just thought well, 'God, if I had to do this, I would not be able to surrender my critical faculties so easily. And if that's what's required to save my life, I think I'm not going to make this.' And the journey I've gone on in writing this play, I've softened a lot about all of that stuff, because essentially it's just about realizing that there are things that are beyond your control; that you can't control."" You don't know at the end of the play if she's going to be all right. And that's really important, because we can't know. I didn't want to be in a play that sugarcoated any of this. Denise Gough Part of the process the addicts go through at the recovery center — where most of the play takes place — is rehearsing what they'll say to people, out in the quote-unquote real world. It's something that Emma, who's an actress, is well-versed at. But Denise Gough says once Emma ventures outside and confronts the world's people, places and things, she gets knocked for a loop all over again. ""You don't know at the end of the play if she's going to be all right,"" Gough says. ""And that's really important, because we can't know. I didn't want to be in a play that sugarcoated any of this. There's no point. I've met and know and I've been around too many people who have suffered this disease to go on stage and say there's a happy ending. We don't know that. It's one day at a time."" That's a life-and-death point Macmillan says he wanted to make. ""One day at a time,"" he says. ""And life has to win every single day. And death only has to win once.""

npr,"October 28, 2017",'I Can't Breathe' Shows Us Eric Garner's Life — Not Just His Death," CD/Spoken Word, 10 audio discs (13 hr.) | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? The death of Eric Garner is a good place to start if you want to tell a story about our politically divided country. At least, that's the case Matt Taibbi makes in his new book, and quite successfully. I Can't Breathe, which takes its title from Garner's last words, traces his life from adolescence to his final day. It was July 17th, 2014. Garner was approached by two NYPD officers for allegedly selling a ""loosie"" cigarette. (Something he most likely hadn't done, according to Taibbi's reporting — at least, not at that time of day.) A bystander filmed what happened next in a video that went viral: When Garner resisted arrest, Officer Daniel Pantaleo placed him in a chokehold and brought him down. Once restrained, Garner remained face down on the sidewalk, surrounded by police who seemed inattentive to his condition. According to the city medical examiner's report, Garner died of compression to the neck from Pantaleo's chokehold, and compression of his chest as police restrained him. Garner's death sparked national outrage. His life, no longer his own, became a symbol for police misconduct and brutality, systematic racism, and eventually, as Taibbi describes it, ""America's pathological desire to avoid equal treatment under the law of its black population."" But Taibbi's primary objective in I Can't Breathe is to show us Garner as he lived, a ""flesh-and-blood person — interesting, imperfect, funny, ambitious, and alive."" So who was he? Eric Garner was a towering man of mild manner and good street sense, who lived by his own ethical code. He conducted business as a bootleg cigarette salesman on Bay Street, across from Staten Island's drug-infested Tompkinsville Park, selling at a discount to drunks, dopers, and middle-class commuters on their way into Manhattan. Rain or shine, Garner could be found on his Bay Street block, where he sometimes kept the peace by breaking up fights and other altercations — in part to avoid generating too much heat in his place of business. In many ways, Garner's story is a familiar one: He fell in love and got married too early, still in his teens. His wife, Esaw, already had two kids, throwing Garner into fatherhood — a responsibility that seemed to govern the rest of his life. He turned to drug dealing, first to supplement his income from odd jobs, then full time. He was first arrested for selling crack in the mid-1990s, and from that point on he was in and out of prison on drug charges so often that it became routine. ""Garner was no kingpin,"" writes Taibbi. ""He didn't have the stomach for what it would take to get there."" So he tried for a cleaner path by selling bootleg cigarettes. Here, he found himself — as he told a friend: ""Felony money, misdemeanor time."" But New York City in that period was in the throes of aggressive policing — the broken windows theory, the implementation of stop and frisk policies, and a system called CompStat, where crime statistics were analyzed to produce arrest quotas. CompStat forced police to keep their arrest numbers high, which led to more mistakes made — wrongful harassment, unnecessary arrests, or worse, beatings, homicides, and fatalities. Taibbi spends many chapters implicating police policies, and particularly these three ideas. They are the reasons, he argues, that Garner came into contact with police that day. And he backs his reasoning up with many horrifying instances of police misconduct and brutality — mostly within Garner's community — pummeling readers over and over; the effect is like being beaten by a storm out at sea, wave after wave. [Taibbi] backs his reasoning up with many horrifying instances of police misconduct and brutality ... the effect is like being beaten by a storm out at sea, wave after wave. But where I Can't Breathe becomes most riveting is in the aftermath of Garner's death, as district attorney Dan Donovan fails to get a grand jury to indict Officer Pantaleo. Donovan passes up justice for Garner to preserve his own political ambitions, while civil rights groups struggle to get a judge to disclose that grand jury's minutes so they can find out what went wrong. By now these injustices are part of the fabric of our history. Taibbi isn't trying to win over any skeptics about Garner's case. He's a contributing editor to Rolling Stone, and his style is a distant cousin to the gonzo tradition of that publication. He's not afraid to make a character he deems villainous look buffoonish — like Donovan, who has ""a long neck ending in a small blond head, like a yellow lollipop."" Does Taibbi's style undermine his reporting? Slightly. But the legwork he's done, and hours he put into documenting Garner's home base, talking with his family and friends, and capturing the people of Tompkinsville Park make all the difference. Taibbi treats the people on Garner's side with much more compassion — particularly his daughter, Erica, who is relentless in her pursuit of justice for her father. Like Erica, Garner's family and friends speak of him honestly, testify to his decent nature, his limited choices, his bad decisions, and what was taken from him. By the end, Garner's portrait is fully alive and breathing. But as I Can't Breathe grimly reminds us, the forces that killed him are equally alive, and as powerful as ever.

The Reformation era was marked by Imperial Diets of all sorts that resulted in excommunications, schisms and wars. Today, our diets are marked by gluten sensitivity, veganism and nut allergies, which can be equally divisive and certainly just as deadly. The following possibilities invite partakers to take up their forks and sin boldly. Loading... What does this mean? We should respect and love God and God's good creation that we may not despise delicious foods, for as Martin Luther himself wrote in a letter to Jerome Weller in July of 1530: ""Be strong and of good courage, and by all means throw aside these monstrous thoughts. Whenever the devil vexes you with these thoughts, seek the company of others, or drink more, joke more, make nonsense, or engage in some other form of merriment. Sometimes one must drink more, joke, make nonsense, and even commit some sin in defiance and contempt of the devil in order not to give him an opportunity to make us scrupulous about trifles.""

npr,"October 27, 2017","Women Are Speaking Up About Harassment And Abuse, But Why Now?"," For decades, women generally kept quiet about being sexually harassed — or even assaulted — at work. But that may be starting to change. The recent New York Times and New Yorker exposés on Harvey Weinstein helped open the flood gates for women who allege they too have been victims. The #MeToo campaign lead to more stories. So we wondered — why now? Let's start by taking a look at what happened to a woman who came forward at a time when we didn't talk about this stuff. In October, 1991, all eyes were on a Senate hearing in Washington: Anita Hill — an African-American law professor — went before an all-male panel to testify that then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas had sexually harassed her. ""His conversations were very vivid,"" she told them. ""He spoke about acts that he had seen, and pornographic films involving such matters as women having sex with animals, and films showing group sex or rape scenes."" It was a very, very trying day ... They were exhibiting the exact kind of behavior that keeps people from coming forward. Anita Hill In response, the senators grilled her. ""Why in God's name would you ever speak to a man like that the rest of your life?"" asked Wyoming Republican Alan Simpson. ""How could you allow this kind of reprehensible conduct to go on right in the headquarters without doing something about it?"" thundered Pennsylvania's Arlen Specter. And of course this, from Alabama Democrat Howell Heflin: ""Are you a scorned woman?"" Anita Hill kept her cool. ""It was a very, very trying day,"" she says. Today, Hill teaches law, social policy and gender studies at Brandeis University. She says that by asking questions like '""why didn't you speak up?"" the senators were providing their own answers. ""They were exhibiting the exact kind of behavior that keeps people from coming forward."" Shame. Character assassinations. The episode took over Hill's life; she was famously referred to as ""a little bit nutty and a little bit slutty."" Years later the author of that line apologized, saying it wasn't true. Crucially, there were three other women in Washington ready to testify, to corroborate Hill's account. The senate panel never called them. Hill says, back then, sexual harassment wasn't taken seriously. ""You even had courts that said, 'Well, these are personal matters and not any matter that the law has any business dealing with,'"" Hill recalls. ""That could never happen now,"" says Niobe Way. ""The one good thing I have to say about the culture right now is, literally, that could never happen now."" Way teaches developmental psychology at New York University. She remembers watching the Anita Hill hearing. ""Looking back on it, it sort of embarrasses me that I didn't see it as the larger issue that it was. I saw it as an issue true to that context, and that Anita Hill was speaking her truth. But I didn't see it as a larger pattern."" And while many people discredited Hill, her testimony opened the window. Sexual harassment claims to the Equal Opportunity Employment Office doubled. Over time, awareness and coverage of sexual misconduct became part of the culture. ""Since 1991, we have been raising children — daughters in particular — with the understanding that sexual harassment is illegal, shouldn't be tolerated, and that it's wrong,"" Hill says. The more women speak out, the more other women want to speak out. Gloria Allred And more and more we have scenes like the recent press conference given by attorney Gloria Allred, in which she introduced two more women accusing Bill Cosby of sexual assault. Allred represents many alleged victims of such high profile figures as Cosby and Weinstein, and her work covers sexual misconduct cases in entertainment, the military, sports and other fields. ""I like women to have access to justice,"" she says. Allred thinks the reason so many women are coming forward now is a kind of domino effect. ""The more women speak out, the more other women want to speak out,"" she says. ""And those who have, in their view, perpetrated wrongs against them now are facing accountability in the court of public opinion. The wrongdoers — or the alleged wrongdoers — have faced severe consequences themselves."" Cosby. Bill O'Reilly. The late Roger Ailes. Harvey Weinstein. Mighty figures continue to fall, daily. Did their accusers speak out because of the reasons we've talked about — strength in numbers? Greater awareness? Consequences for perpetrators? Reporter Ronan Farrow, who covered Weinstein for The New Yorker, told NPR earlier this month that there's another reason women are coming forward. ""A factor in their decision was that he was less able to hurt them, was one exact quote that was used by one,"" Farrow said. ""And look, you've seen that in a number of cases about high-profile men recently, that allegations only emerged when their grip on power and success slips."" ... you've seen that in a number of cases about high-profile men recently, that allegations only emerged when their grip on power and success slips. Ronan Farrow But most everyone I interviewed for this story says the real catalyst has to do with the infamous Access Hollywood video released by The Washington Post last year, in which Donald Trump brags about grabbing women. That tape rankled a lot of women — and then, during the presidential campaign there were also allegations of sexual misconduct against Trump. ""Trump has reinvigorated feminism and the women's movement in a way that nothing has done for decades,"" says journalist Jodi Enda. She points to the Women's March on Washington the day after President Trump's inauguration. The march drew one of the largest crowds ever to the nation's capital. Enda covered it for CNN. ""That was sort of the first inkling that we had that this was really something,"" she says. ""That women were upset, and — like the old movie — they weren't gonna take it anymore."" But, clearly, not every woman feels the same way — 42 percent voted for President Trump. It's also true that there are plenty of women who don't feel safe speaking up about sexual harassment and assault. So does the fact that so many are coming forward now mean we've reached a true turning point? Niobe Way says no. ""We don't address the problem. The deeper, deeper problem — not the superficial problem, but the deeper problem."" We essentially raise boys in a culture that asks them to disconnect from their core humanity, which is their desire for relationships and all sorts of things the boys articulate that they want. Niobe Way That problem is the way boys are raised, says Way. She's been looking at this for more than two decades — her book is called Deep Secrets: Boys' Friendships and the Crisis of Connection. ""We essentially raise boys in a culture that asks them to disconnect from their core humanity, which is their desire for relationships and all sorts of things the boys articulate that they want,"" she says. ""Not only disconnect from it, but say 'if you are that way, emotional, relational et cetera, you're not a man.'"" Way says that leads to a culture that accepts lonely and aggressive boys, and ultimately puts them in positions of power. I ran this idea by some students at American University. Men and women alike nodded in agreement. ""The first thing that came to my mind is the whole 'boys will be boys' thing,"" says Jean Thompson. She and fellow student Matt Goldan point to movies and TV shows that depict the old stereotypes: Superman. Romantic comedies. ""In the culture, you have a sense of toxic masculinity, where men are kind of expected to have bravado, to be a little bit more aggressive in talking to women,"" he says. ""Pay for dinner,"" Thompson interjects. ""Pay for dinner, yeah, absolutely,"" Goldan says. ""So right off the bat you have a sense of very very different roles. And I think it makes it easier for that whole messaging to get distorted in a way that could be conducive to sexual assault. And not just sexual assault, says Niobe Way, but all kinds of violence. She says our culture continues to divide these problems as if their roots are different. ""We look at mass violence and we're all writing articles about mass violence. Then we have a rapist and we're all writing articles about rape. The we have an article about police violence and we're focused on police violence, without understanding there's a common root across these problems. If you raise boys to go against their nature, some of them will grow up and act crazy."" Meantime allegations of sexual misconduct — and consequences for the many of the accused — continue to rise.

npr,"October 27, 2017","In Season Two, 'Stranger Things' Offers More Scares And The Same Quirky Quartet Of Nerds"," Fans of the Netflix TV show ""Stranger Things"" have waited more than a year for new episodes. The series was one of summer 2016's surprise hits. NPR TV critic Eric Deggans says the show's second season which debuts today sneaks up on viewers just like the last time. ERIC DEGGANS, BYLINE: You'd think after defeating a vicious monster from an alternate dimension called the Upside Down, the middle school kids at the heart of Netflix's ""Stranger Things"" would be feeling pretty good. But as the second season opens, it's October 1984, about a year since the events of the first season. And the quirky quartet of nerds from fictional Hawkins, Ind., can't agree on anything, not even which Ghostbuster they're dressed as for Halloween. Lucas, the group's only black kid, says he's dressed as Bill Murray's character, Peter Venkman. But Mike says Lucas should be Ernie Hudson's character, Winston. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""STRANGER THINGS"") FINN WOLFHARD: (As Mike) What's wrong with Winston? CALEB MCLAUGHLIN: (As Lucas) What's wrong with Winston? He joined the team super late. He's not funny. And he's not even a scientist. WOLFHARD: (As Mike) Yeah, but he's so cool. MCLAUGHLIN: (As Lucas) If he's cool, then you be Winston. WOLFHARD: (As Mike) I can't. MCLAUGHLIN: (As Lucas) Why not? WOLFHARD: (As Mike) Because... MCLAUGHLIN: (As Lucas) Because you're not black? WOLFHARD: (As Mike) I didn't say that. MCLAUGHLIN: (As Lucas) You thought it. DEGGANS: It's that kind of period-specific bickering that makes ""Stranger Things"" so much fun. Part sci-fi horror show and part coming-of-age story, it whips together a blend of '80s-style teen drama, Steven Spielberg's Americana and John Carpenter-influenced horror. Last season, the boys teamed with a girl who had telekinetic powers named Eleven. She was raised in a facility called the Hawkins National Laboratory. She also helped rescue one of the boys, doe-eyed Will Byers, who'd been kidnapped by a monster from the Upside Down. As the new season begins, there's a problem. Will has begun having visions of a new monster from the Upside Down taking over our reality. And these visions can strike anytime, even when he's at an arcade with his buddies. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""STRANGER THINGS"") NOAH SCHNAPP: (As Will) Hey, hey, guys, do you see the... DEGGANS: Will's mother, Joyce, played by Winona Ryder with a little less hysteria than last season, takes her son to the laboratory. New people are running the place now, including a charming Dr. Owens played by Paul Reiser. Dr. Owens has his own theory about Will's visions. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""STRANGER THINGS"") PAUL REISER: (As Dr. Owens) It's called the anniversary effect. The anniversary of an event brings back traumatic memories, sort of opens up the neurological floodgates, so to speak. WINONA RYDER: (As Joyce) Well, what do we do when that happens? REISER: (As Dr. Owens) Well, from what we know about post-traumatic stress, just treat him normally. RYDER: (As Joyce) What you're saying is it's going to get worse and worse, and we're just supposed to pretend like it's not happening. REISER: (As Dr. Owens) It sounds counterintuitive. I know. But I assure you that is really the best thing you can do for him. DEGGANS: Anybody who's seen a horror movie knows how this is going to play out. I just loved how Dr. Owens seemed like a subtle homage to one of Reiser's early movie roles as a charismatic corporate weasel in the 1986 movie ""Aliens."" The show's second season starts slowly. Fans eager to jump back into the action won't really see things pick up until the fifth episode. But when it picks up, it becomes seriously entertaining. We will learn Eleven's origin story. We will see a new threat from the Upside Down. And we will meet new characters, including ""Lord Of The Rings"" costar Sean Astin as Joyce's goofy new beau, RadioShack clerk Bob. As Will gets worse, Bob makes the kind of suggestion that every audience member's probably also thinking. Why not just leave Hawkins? (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""STRANGER THINGS"") SEAN ASTIN: (As Bob) My parents are selling their house in Maine. There's a RadioShack nearby. I'm sure they'd take me on. RYDER: (As Joyce) It's hard to explain. It's - this is not a normal family. DEGGANS: Which is why I love ""Stranger Things"" so much. Even when it's scaring us and jolting us, it stops to take a poke at its own absurdity. I'm Eric Deggans.

npr,"October 27, 2017",'Ghosts of the Tsunami' Shows How 2011 Event Transformed Japan," In his new book ""Ghosts Of The Tsunami,"" the British journalist Richard Lloyd Parry describes how that day transfigured both the physical landscape and the interior mental landscape of the people who survived. Richard Lloyd Parry is Asia editor for The Times of London as well as Tokyo bureau chief, and he joins us from Tokyo. Thanks for being with us today. RICHARD LLOYD PARRY: That's a pleasure. SIEGEL: When I think back to March 2011 and the tsunami that struck Japan, I think mostly of the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. But you focus on a different catastrophe, what happened at the Okawa Elementary School. And I want you to describe what happened there. PARRY: Well, the Okawa Elementary School was a very ordinary little school in a village in the far northeast of Japan. It was by a big river. It was a small school for hundreds of kids. And like other schools all over the area, when the earthquake struck that afternoon they knew exactly what to do. They got under their desks at first. Then the teachers escorted them outside, they lined up in their classes, and their names were ticked off. And everyone was fine. The problem is that unlike many other schools along that coast, they stayed put. They stayed in the playground. There was a hill behind the school where within five minutes they could have been safely out of reach of any disaster. But they didn't climb it. And 51 minutes later the tsunami came and rushed in. The children scattered. And all but four of the 78 children and all but one of the 13 teachers who were in the school at the time perished. SIEGEL: And in part what you're writing about, although you're writing about much more than that, was the question of, was that a case of negligence? Should those children have survived? Should better decisions have been made at the school during those 51 minutes? PARRY: That's right. I mean, one of the things that drew me to the story is that there are several elements to it. But one element is this kind of mystery, in a way, almost a conspiracy story - why the children died, why this had to happen. And after the initial shock and horror of what had had happened, a number of the parents who'd lost children at the school started to ask questions, started to push for answers, and became very involved in trying to uncover the truth. SIEGEL: You came to know some of the families it seems pretty well. What was it about them that you found so compelling that you went back to interview them several times? PARRY: I mean, this - in this disaster on that day, almost 18,500 people died. It was a colossal catastrophe. And the problem when you're trying to turn this into a story is making it manageable. I mean, how do you comprehend disaster on that scale? And fairly early on, I heard about the school. And it struck me then that this was possibly the worst of all the many terrible stories that happened that day. But also, it wasn't just a natural disaster. I mean, a country like Japan has suffered from tsunamis for as long as there have been Japanese islands. It's just part of the seismology of that part of the world. You get earthquakes and the waves that follow them. And Japanese have been dying in tsunamis as long as there have been Japanese. But this wasn't just an act of God. This was also a human disaster. It was avoidable. And there was a story behind it and a politics to it which also made it fascinating and fearful as well. SIEGEL: A theme that runs throughout your book is the tension between the grief and resolve of the parents whose children died at Okawa Elementary School, the need for some accountability, some acceptance of responsibility by the authorities for not having evacuated the area properly and, on the other hand, an officialdom that could be, as you describe it, very gracious. They bowed very deeply. They could be very polite. But they couldn't admit that something terrible had gone wrong here that might have been their fault. And there's a conversation you relate with Sayomi Shito where she describes that conflict in an interesting way. I'm wondering if you could just read that passage. PARRY: (Reading) The children were murdered by an invisible monster, Sayomi Shito said once. We vent our anger on it, but it doesn't react. It's like a black shadow. It has no human warmth. She went on, the tsunami was a visible monster, but the invisible monster will last forever. I asked, what is the invisible monster? I wonder myself what it is, said Sayomi. Something peculiar in the Japanese, who only attach importance to the surface of things. And in the pride of people who cannot ever say sorry. SIEGEL: It's a very trenchant criticism of the bureaucracy that she was up against at that time. PARRY: Yes, that's what she was talking about. She was very bitter about the way the authorities dealt with the disaster not only because through incompetence all these children had been allowed to die, but also because of the really, I mean, very candid and half-hearted way that the mistakes were covered up, when attempt was made to cover them up afterwards. That - you know, that was a very just criticism. And Sayomi and other people who lost kids in the school felt that very bitterly. SIEGEL: Here in the U.S. we have a number of people in Texas and Florida and in Northern California, Puerto Rico recovering from natural disasters, none so lethal as the tsunami that hit Japan in 2011. I was wondering, is there any takeaway as Americans pick up the pieces of their broken lives, anything that they could learn from the experience of the families who survived the tsunami? PARRY: It's very difficult, isn't it? There are no - there are no easy answers. And I think what I learned in the course of following this story and writing this book is that there isn't any easy consolation. There are no easy answers. And anyone who offers glib answers is fibbing. But I suppose what you can say is that these disasters, you know, although they bring out conflict as well - one has to acknowledge that - they also show up in very stark form, you know, the strength and weaknesses of societies. And that's something that you can learn from not at the moment of the disaster and the immediate aftermath, but afterwards. I mean, I've been observing those various disasters in the United States which you listed from afar, you know, out - from out in Japan. But I suspect that they do reveal strengths, but also weaknesses and flaws in the societies where they occurred and fissures in the politics of the United States as well, to put it mildly. And that's something you can reflect on and learn from. And people in Japan, I think, have been trying to do that, too. SIEGEL: Richard Lloyd Parry's book is called ""Ghosts Of The Tsunami: Death And Life In Japan's Disaster Zone."" Thanks for talking with us today. PARRY: It's been a great pleasure, Robert.

npr,"October 27, 2017",Who Says You Can't Train A Cat? A Book Of Tips For Feline-Human Harmony," This is FRESH AIR. I'm David Bianculli, editor of the website TV Worth Watching, sitting in for Terry Gross. The common wisdom about pets is that you can train a dog, but you can't train a cat. Today's guest says you can train a cat, but it takes an understanding of how cats learn. Sarah Ellis is the co-author with John Bradshaw of the book, ""The Trainable Cat,"" which is now out in paperback. Among the things she's trained her cats to do is come when she calls, voluntarily walk into the cat carrier to go to the vet, take medicine and be friendly to her dog and her baby. Ellis is a feline behavior specialist at the British charity group International Cat Care, which collaborates with organizations around the world involved with cat welfare. She's also a visiting fellow at the University of Lincoln in England. Terry spoke with her last year. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST) TERRY GROSS, HOST:  Sarah Ellis, welcome to FRESH AIR. Why are cats more difficult to train than dogs, and do you even agree with the premise that cats are more difficult to train than dogs? SARAH ELLIS: I think, yes, they can be more difficult, but it's all about having a little bit more patience and a little bit more understanding of what the cat is in terms of its behavior and where it's come from. And then once owners have that understanding, the patience comes much more naturally, and then they can see that training is possible. GROSS: But as you point out, you can't train cats the same way that you train dogs. I mean, it's similar but different because cats respond to different things and they have different sensory ways of intaking information. One of the things you point out is that dogs are creatures of habit, cats are creatures of place. What does that mean? ELLIS: OK, so, yeah, I think the fundamental difference between dogs and cats and how it influences the way that they perceive training is that dogs are innately very, very sociable. They have evolved from a social animal, the wolf, and they are incredibly sociable not just to their own species but to humans. The cat, however, has evolved from a solitary ancestor, the North African wildcat, and that process of domestication has also been much, much shorter, if you like. And therefore, the cat hasn't had the chance to develop these social tendencies that the dog already has. So because of that, the cat's a little bit more on the back foot or the back paw, if you like. They're less likely to understand our - the cues that we may give, for example, things like pointing. They're less likely to naturally attune to us. So they're much less likely to look at our faces, to be able to read our expressions. GROSS: When you say cats are creatures of place, not of habit, what do you mean by that? ELLIS: OK, so going back to this idea that dogs are really sociable and cats less so - because of that, the primary attachment for a dog is generally its owner. By an attachment bond, think of, like, a mother and their child. It's that bond being around - a child to be around its mother creates a feeling of safety and security. And when you go to a new place as a child, as long as your mother or your parent is there, you still feel a sense of safety, and that's the same for a dog. So for when a dog goes to the vet's with its owner, the dog still feels relatively safe and secure and could cope with the environment because its owner's there, that security blanket. For the cats, that security does not necessarily come from a person or another animal. It comes from a physical place. Cats are very, very territorial animals, and they create safety by getting to know a physical place very well and by marking that place and impregnating it with their own scent. So when we take the cat out of that physical environment, we've taken away their safety or their security, and that's why they don't cope nearly as well in novel environments. GROSS: And what are the implications of that for training a cat? ELLIS: Well, the first thing is many of the things that we want to train a cat involve novel places. So you mentioned already going to the vet's, the boarding cattery, moving house, et cetera. And one of the ways that we tend to move cats is we put them in a cat carrier. And so those things are intrinsically stressful for a cat because they're taking them away from their place of safety and security. So the first thing we would want to teach a cat - I think every cat should be taught this as a life skill - is that the cat carrier can become a portable place of safety and security. It is a safe, secure place and is part of the cat's normal territory. And now we have a portable item of security, just like for the dog, its owner, for the cat, its cat carrier. And that's the foundation, I think, for training in terms of novelty. GROSS: So with a cat carrier, to teach the cat that it's a safe place and it's safe to be there when you're taking the cat to a new location, whether it's the airport or the vet, do you keep your carrier out all the time so that it's a very familiar part of the cat's environment, as if it were a piece of furniture in the house? ELLIS: Yeah, absolutely. That's what we would really like to encourage cat owners to do. Currently, what most cat owners do is they keep the cat carrier hidden in a closet or in the basement. And the day that the cat has to go to the vet's, they tend to bring it out. And what that does for the cat is it becomes a very predictive signal that something unpleasant is about to come because they've already made this association between the cat carrier and the travel or the vet's. Instead, as you say, if we keep the cat carrier out all the time, it becomes a regular part of the furniture within their territory. They get the opportunity to facial mark it and to sleep in it and to eat in it, so to have positive experiences within it and also to impregnate their own scent onto it, which is how they feel safe and secure. And therefore it's already a part of their home, so we're taking that place with them when we take them somewhere new. I think the main reason, at the moment, that owners don't do that is that cat carriers don't look particularly pleasant and people don't like the look of them out in their homes. And I think really for - to improve that, we really need to think about nicer, cleaner designs of cat carrier that not only function as a cat carrier but that owners would be happy to leave out in their homes at all time. GROSS: Cats live in the present, and you say any reward or punishment that you use for a cat - and, by the way, you recommend against punishment, and we'll get to that a little bit later - but any reward or punishment should happen immediately after the action. So what kind of problem sets in if you wait a couple of minutes? ELLIS: If you wait a couple of minutes, what you'll, in effect, be rewarding is the behavior that's happening in those couple of minutes later. So cats really, really are a little bit unforgiving, if you like - as are many other animals - in terms of if you are not good with your timing of your training. And by timing, I mean the delivery of the reward because they need to have the two things happening very, very close in time to know that the association is between those two things. And that's classical conditioning. That's not necessarily unique for the cat. That's the same with any animal. So we need to have a message to tell them that was exactly it, right now, right there, what you're doing. If we cannot give the reward at that exact time, and usually the reward is food, we can use other things to pinpoint or reward or mark that behavior that allows the cat to know that food is going to come two minutes later. But the only way you can do that is, first of all, to create an association between whatever your marker behavior is and your reward. So if I give you an example, quite often - let's say we were teaching a cat to go through a cat flap. I couldn't give him the food at the moment that he's going through the cat flap. GROSS: A cat flap is like a cat door, one of those little cat doors. ELLIS: Yeah, a cat door. The behavior that we would want to reward, going through the cat door or jumping down, we cannot give food at that exact moment in time because we might not physically be able to get the food to the other side of the cat door or to the cat the minute its - the second its feet lands on the floor. So we can use something that we call a marker. And in this case, very often with cats, I just use a word, and that word's often just good. But what you have to do before that is teach the cat that the word good predicts that the real reward, the food, is going to come. And you do that just simply by pairing those two things, presenting the word good, so saying it and then giving food. And doing that time again. And then you know the cat has learned the association when you just say the word, good, and the cat orientates towards you. It might meow at you. It shows you all the behaviors that it normally shows you that are indicative that it knows food is on its way. Then you've got a tool that will allow you to buy those extra few seconds, but it's not going to be a few minutes. It's only going to be a few seconds. GROSS: OK, so when you're teaching a cat to respond to a word like good, what exactly is the cat hearing? Do you have any idea? And I have this habit - I don't know if it's annoying to my cat or what, but, I sometimes talk to my cat in a falsetto (imitating high voice) like this. (LAUGHTER) GROSS: I don't know where that comes from, but I don't know, like, is it the rhythm of the word? Is it the, you know, like - our cat's name is Rowdy (ph), and I'll call him like, Rowdy. And, you know, so is he hearing the melody of that sound or, like - what's the best way to talk to a cat? ELLIS: Cats generally cope well with quiet voices. They don't like very loud voices. That can be frightening for them. And they do tend to like female voices a lot because they attune very well to high pitch. Their auditory system is very much designed to hear high-pitch sounds because prey make very, very high-pitch sounds and, therefore, they do tend to orientate towards high sounds better. So I don't think it's a problem at all if owners are speaking to their cats in the more sort of baby-voice-type language. GROSS: You recommend against punishment. You're all for reward. Why is punishment bad? And we're not talking about, you know, beating the cat, but just, like, a negative response like squirting the cat with water or shaking noisy keys at it. ELLIS: Yeah, the reason that we don't advocate punishment at all is because it can be really, really damaging to the relationship of the cat with the human. If you get your timing wrong, you may be punishing a very different behavior to what you think you're punishing, and that can be quite disastrous. And, secondly, if you're delivering that punishment - so you are holding a water sprayer, or you are throwing something at the cat, or you are physically, you know, smacking its back end off the kitchen counter, whatever it is, the cat will associate that punishment with you and may not associate it with the actual act of what it's doing because you're very salient in that environment, at that time, and you are the one delivering the punishment. And so all you're doing then is teaching your cat that you are not a very good person to be around, that you deliver quite unpleasant consequences and, therefore, the cat will start to avoid you rather than stopping to do that behavior. GROSS: So how do you teach a cat not to do something, to stop doing something? ELLIS: So it very much depends on the behavior. But what we would do is try and teach on incompatible behavior. So we would teach the cat to do something else instead that meant they couldn't do the behavior that was undesired. And we would make a different behavior very, very rewarding, so they were very, very motivated to do it. We would also find out what the particular behavior was that they were doing that was undesirable and why they were motivated to do that behavior. And we have to think about is it a behavior that they actually need to do for their own welfare? So, for example, let's say, scratching, and they're scratching the furniture as opposed to scratching on their scratch post. We couldn't just stop that behavior completely because it's a natural behavior for cats, and it's something that they should be allowed to do, and we should accept that they do as part of being a cat. So, therefore, we think we would want to train the cat to redirect that behavior onto something that we would consider much more appropriate, rather than stop it completely. GROSS: Like a scratching post? ELLIS: Like a scratching post, exactly. GROSS: My experience is cats love the furniture and the scratching post. ELLIS: (Laughter). GROSS: You're just adding more joy in their lives, but you're not discouraging them from scratching the things you don't want them to scratch. ELLIS: And, I think, for cats that are housed indoor only, they will often scratch in multiple places within the home because they will often scratch at multiple places within their territory, at the boundary of their territories. So for cats that are allowed outdoor access, that's often outdoors. But for cats that don't have outdoor access, those multiple points are often within the home. So it's a case of educating owners that, actually, one scratch post is often not enough. Most of us just don't have one chair in our house. We have several chairs, and we'll sit in different ones and, therefore, we need to think about being providing extra resources for our cats - more than one scratch post. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Sarah Ellis. She's a cat behavior specialist and co-author of the new book, ""The Trainable Cat."" Let's take a short break, and then we'll talk some more. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF DICK HYMAN AND IVAN DAVIS AND MAURICE PERESS'S ""KITTEN ON THE KEYS"") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR, and if you're just joining us, my guest is Sarah Ellis. She's a cat behavior specialist and her new book, ""The Trainable Cat"" is all about how to train cats. And she says, yes, cats are trainable. OK, so let's start with, like, a basic training thing, teaching a cat to respond to the cat's name and to come when you call it. So as a positive reinforcer, you recommend, you know, a treat. And one of the things you do is have meat paste in a syringe. I mean, I don't even know where to get meat paste. I've never even heard of meat paste. ELLIS: (Laughter) So I... GROSS: Oh, and, by the way, I should mention the syringe, it's not to inject the cat. You just kind of squirt it out of the syringe, and so the cat can lick it off the end of it. There's no needle in it. ELLIS: Yeah, absolutely. GROSS: Is syringe the right word to use? ELLIS: Yeah. Yeah. We would call it a syringe, certainly. And then it's a syringe without a needle, so the plastic part of the syringe, if you like. GROSS: Right. ELLIS: But actually, I have a 2-year-old and during weaning off my little boy, I discovered these, like, squeezy tubes that have a spoon attached to them that you can squeeze the tube, and it squeezes the baby food out onto a spoon. And I thought, these are fantastic for training cats because you can squeeze it straight into a spoon, and the cat licks it off the spoon. So it's amazing what things you can find (laughter) which you're not expecting in life at all. But meat paste - there are some cat food that comes canned, and it's like a patty. And you can loosen that patty with a little bit of water to make paste. And I also have a separate very small food mixer, so that I can blend my cat's regular cat meat into a paste, which it sounds a bit disgusting, but trust me, once you've done it once or twice, it's not a problem. And you can buy human-grade meat paste as well. In the U.K., people spread it on their sandwiches, and these kinds of things. You just have to make sure in the ingredients, it doesn't have any additional ingredients that could be toxic to cats. It's worth definitely checking with your vet. GROSS: Spreading it on sandwiches does not sound great to me, but thanks for the advice. ELLIS: No, it's not. (LAUGHTER) ELLIS: It's not something I would eat (laughter), hence why the cat gets it. GROSS: So getting back to teaching a cat to respond to its name and to come when you call it, walk us through the process for doing that. ELLIS: Sure. GROSS: That seems like the very basic training. ELLIS: Yeah, definitely. So most people's cats know their names already, but where people tend to go wrong is they think, oh, he knows his name. I'll use his name to get him to come to me. But because we use their names all the time, it's not a command to say come to me. It's just a word that we say to them that they know they need to give their attention to us. So the first thing we need to do is think about what word are we going to use that actually means I want you to move your body over towards me and stop when you get to me? We tend to use come or here or any word that works well for you. So the word of the cat - the cat's name, let's say I'm training Cosmos, my cat. I would say the word Cosmos to get his attention, but then I would always say the word come to tell him the command of what I'd like you to do, now I've got your attention, is to come towards me. So you have to think about what that word's going to be, first of all. But we don't use that word until a little bit further down the training. The first thing we do is we make sure the cat is actually really quite close to us when we start teaching the recall. And when I say close, I'm meaning like within a meter or two meters, definitely within the same room. And we show the cat that we have something that it really likes - so most commonly food. And so if you've got your food in the paste, you might need to squirt a little bit of that paste out and let the cat smell it or if you've got food in a tub, if you've got some biscuits, you can rattle that to show the cat that you've got it. The cat should come to you purely because it knows you've got food, and it's motivated for that food. So choose a time when the cat's hungry. Choose a food it really, really likes. So as soon as the cat gets up and starts to walk towards you - and we're only talking, at this stage, a few steps - you then give that cat that reward. And you repeat that in different locations, in different places in the house, and you gradually increase the distance between you and the cat. After doing that in different locations within the house and doing it at different distances which are increasing, we can start to do it when the cat can no longer see us. It can just hear us. And so that's quite good fun. When you really know that you've trained well, you can be in a completely different room of the house, call the cat, give your cue word and see if the cat comes. Only once you've got it that good with it then I take it outdoors. So we're generalizing all the time what the cat's learned to different locations. And that's what makes it really strong. GROSS: So once the cat has mastered this training and comes when you call it by saying come, at what point can you stop giving the cat food each time the cat comes and will the cat at some point think like, well, I'm not going to come any more, there's nothing in it for me? ELLIS: (Laughter) Yeah. OK. So it's a little bit like - imagine the food - it's a little bit like your pay for going to work. We wouldn't go to work for nothing ever, really. There has to be some reward at some point, but that reward doesn't have to come every single time once the animal has learned what the cue word means and has got the behavior mastered. What we tend to find in animal training - and this is not just the case for cats. It's for all animals - is that once you've taught a behavior, in order to maintain that behavioral response really strongly, intermittent reinforcement is the best kind. And by that, what we mean is that you don't give a reward every single time. It sort of keeps the cat guessing. They don't know if running toward you this time will get the food or it will be the next time. And that actually makes the behavior more likely to happen. BIANCULLI: That's Sarah Ellis speaking with Terry Gross. Ellis is the co-author of ""The Trainable Cat,"" which is now out in paperback. We'll hear more of their conversation after a break, and film critic David Edelstein will review ""Novitiate,"" the new movie about an order of nuns set in 1964 during the early years of the Vatican II reforms. I'm David Bianculli, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF ROY HARGROVE'S ""EV'RYBODY WANTS TO BE A CAT"") BIANCULLI: This is FRESH AIR. I'm David Bianculli in for Terry Gross back with more of Terry's interview with feline behavior specialist Sarah Ellis. She' co-author of the book ""The Trainable Cat,"" which is now out in now out in paperback. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST) GROSS: So cats are - they're very demanding about certain things, like when they want food. They know that you feed them and they're hungry, and they want you to feed them. They will tell you either by meowing a lot or by biting your foot or scratching your leg - or there are sweeter ways of doing it than that, but there are the more (laughter) assertive ways. So how do you train a cat to, like, not bite you or scratch you? Oh, let me get to another example. This is the best. When you're sleeping - it's your day to sleep late. It's Saturday. You want to sleep late. Your cat doesn't know it's Saturday. Your cat doesn't care that it's Saturday. It wants to be fed at 6:30 in the morning. And so it jumps onto the bed or walks up to the pillow, sticks its paw in your eye (laughter) and says time to get up. How do you train a cat not to do that? ELLIS: OK, so those behaviors happen in the first place because the cats have trained us. We may not be aware of that at the time, but that's basically what's happened. Cats are not necessarily born meowing and screaming at us for food. It's a behavior that they learn. They're also not born innately to bite our noses when we sleep and scratch our eyes when we sleep. Again, it's another behavior that they try out through trial and error, learn that it has a very, very - it's very effective 'cause it gets exactly the response they would like, and therefore they use it again and again. So the first thing I would say is that owners who have found that their cats are meowing incessantly for food and driving them bonkers is to think about what have you done in the past when your cat has done those behaviors? It is likely that you have gone, oh, goodness me, he's meowing again, just give him some food for him to be quiet. What we've done, remember, is we've reinforced the meowing behavior. So we're just going to make it worse and worse and worse for ourselves 'cause our cats are going to go, oh, that is a behavior that I need to do to get food. And if one day we think, I'm not going to do that anymore, I'm really sick of him meowing for food and I don't want him to do that, I want to try and stop him doing that, and day one, he meows and he meows and you're really strong and you think, no, he's not going to get food for that. And day two and day three - and then by day four, you've had a really, really bad day at work and you're really tired and you've got a bad headache and he is still meowing for food and you think, no, no, I'm going to be strong-willed here. He's not going to get food now. He's going to have to wait until he's quiet another time and then he can have food. And you let him meow for much, much longer than normal, and then you just can't take it anymore and you give him the food. You've made the whole situation even worse because now the cat's learned, oh, I have to meow for, like, 20 minutes instead of 10 minutes for you to give me the food. So what we have to warn owners in that situation is we have to put the behavior on what we call an extinction schedule, if we want to use a real scientific term. That is that this behavior is no longer reinforced. So if you wake me up in the middle of the night, I will no longer get up and feed you just so I can go back to bed. What we need to explain to owners is if they can be really strong with that extinction schedule and just make sure at every occurrence of that behavior they do not reward it, is that it will stop. GROSS: I think a common problem that a lot of pet owners face is that, you know, they have, say, a cat and they want to also adopt another cat or a dog or they have a new baby that's about to arrive, and you have to acclimate the cat that you already have to the newcomer and vice versa. And you have a lot of suggestions for training the cat to deal with the new baby or the new animal that's coming to the house. Can you take us through some of those steps? ELLIS: Yeah, sure. So as humans, we're really naturally very, very sociable. We like extending our families, we like having - if we love cats, we want more cats. The cat doesn't see the world like that at all. Remember, it's evolved from a solitary animal. And so suddenly being asked to share its territory with somebody or something that's very unfamiliar to it can be a real - really quite stressful experience for a cat. So while we might welcome with open arms a new baby or a new cat, and we have an understanding that this already is a family member for us, the cat doesn't. For the cat, it's - the analogy would be like if a - you just came home from work and a stranger was sleeping in your bed. It's really quite a sort of freak-out situation. But when cats - they do have the ability to form social relationships with one another, and it really depends on the individual cat to what extent they can. The way that they do so and the way that they maintain those social relationships is very often through scent, through - they have very, very good sense of smell. And while we generally recognize our family members through sight and through the sound of their voices, for cats, it will be through their - how they smell. So the first thing that we try to do when we're trying to introduce them to a new cat or a new baby, et cetera, is to think about all the sensory information that that new being brings, particularly smell but also sight and sound, and gradually introduce the cat to them over a slow period of time and in a way that the sensory elements are, in their first instance, quite dilute and then come right up to their sort of real level of what they are. GROSS: How do you introduce a new person's smell or a new animal's smell to a cat? ELLIS: OK, so we're going to use an example of a new cat. If we brought a new cat home from the shelter, we would want to keep it in a completely different part of the house from the resident cat, ideally a single room so that that new cat gets a chance to get used to one area that's not too big before we introduce it to other areas. And one of the first ways that we can introduce the two cats to each other's smell is simply by swapping the bedding, taking the bedding that they've been sleeping on, which will be heavily impregnated with their scent, and placing that in each other's territories, making sure that they still have some bedding of their own, as well 'cause, remember, they feel safe and secure when the area smells of them. Cats produce scent, which we cannot detect. Our noses are not strong enough to be able to - or good enough to be able to detect it. And then they also produce these chemicals known as pheromones that are species-specific. So we - they mean nothing to us. We cannot detect them. And they're produced from in between the toes, at the base of the tail, down the flanks but primarily around the face. So do you know under the chin, they love to be scratched and just behind the whiskers on the cheeks, and do you know those areas in front of their ears where there seems to be a lot less hair between the ears and the eyes? GROSS: Yeah. ELLIS: That area there is a very concentrated area where - of sebaceous glands that produce these facial pheromones, these specific chemicals that cats use to communicate with one another. So rubbing a cloth over these facial regions will impregnate that cloth with a scent of that individual cat, which if we smelt that cloth, we would smell nothing. But if we put that into the environment of the other cat, they would very much be able to detect the presence of another cat there. GROSS: And you also have pictures of how you trained your cat at home to accept a second cat. So you have both cats in walled-off spaces but in the same room. So, like, there's some kind of, like, little fence between them or their own - they're each in their own little crates. So they're in the same room, but they're completely protected from each other so that they learn to acclimate to each other without fear of being attacked. ELLIS: Yeah, so once they've got used to the smell of each other and they've heard each other and they're happy with all those things, then we would physically introduce them so that they could see each other. And by this stage, they should be able to recognize each other by smell. So it shouldn't be like, oh, my goodness, who is this creature in my house because they've already smelt this animal and they'll match the smell. But as a safety measure, we would always make sure that they can't physically interact at the beginning beyond just a nose-to-nose greeting. When cats tend to meet each other, they do so by sniffing each other at their noses. And then if they are well-known to one another and part of the same familial group, they may go on to then facial rub. But for cats, when we're introducing them to each other, a nose-to-nose touch or sniff is simply enough that that's all we would be really looking for with no agonistic or hostile behaviors. And so they're able to do this through a barrier, through a mesh door or through a baby gate. But we've prevented the opportunity for any hostile behavior in the eventuality that it did occur because we know from scientific study that if at the first true meeting, cats fight, then the chances of us being able to get those cats to live together is really, really difficult. And the first meeting is really crucial. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Sarah Ellis. She's a cat behavior specialist and co-author of the new book, ""The Trainable Cat."" Let's take a short break here, then we'll talk some more. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF GOLDENBOY'S ""KITTENS OF LUST"") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is cat behavior specialist Sarah Ellis. She's co-author of the new book, ""The Trainable Cat,"" and she insists cats can be trained. A lot of people who have cats have problems with the cat urinating outside of the litter box, and that's an example - like, I have no clue how you would train a cat to not do that. ELLIS: Yeah, the - one of the things is people often think you have to teach a cat to use the litter tray or the litter box, and you don't. You don't have to teach kittens to use the litter box. When they feel a substance under their feet that's very fine and rakable, instinctively they will toilet on it. So the reasons that sometimes they don't use the litter box is because the litter box is not clean enough. Remember, they have this really, really good sense of smell. And while we might not be able to smell the odors coming from it, the cats certainly can. Their noses are closer to the soiled litter and that they have this much better, much more acute sense of smell. And they're fastidious about being clean. So if that litter tray has not been - a litter box has not been scooped in the morning or in the evening, they might choose not to use it. Often, cat litters are designed with us as a consumer in mind rather than our cat, and they are not desirable to our cat in terms of the sensation they create on their feet. They might not be fine and rakable enough or we may place the litter box in an area that the cat doesn't feel is safe and secure. Lots of people put them in their basement next to their tumble dryer or their laundry machine or the washing machine. And for a cat, it's horrible to have that vibration or that noise right next to when they want to go to the bathroom. So these are some of the reasons that cats might not want to use the litter box. There is a whole other range of reasons that are medical related. And so we always, always advise if your cat is not using the litter box, to make sure the first thing you do is to take it to the vet's. So it's not just a simple case of being able to train the cat to use the litter box, it's more that they instinctively know how to do that. It's just that the litter box provided to them is perhaps not desirable because of cleanliness, the substrate that's in it or its location or that it has to share it with another cat. And if those two cats in the home do not consider each other part of their same social group, then they were not going to share a toilet together. GROSS: You know, we're talking about, like, training cats and why that's good for the cat and good for the people. Cats, especially indoor cats, need exercise. And so play is not only, like, a fun activity for the cat and the person but it's also, like, really healthy for the cat. I sometimes wonder if my cat understands that he's engaged in a very Sisyphean activity because (laughter) once - (laughter) like, especially, like, with a laser toy, like, there's no way you're going to actually capture that laser beam, you know? And even with, like, the feather toys - the wand feather toys - like, what do you do with it once you've captured it, you know? You play with it a while and then I'm going to whip it around again and then you capture it again and then I'm going to whip it around again. You know what I'm saying? Like, do cats get frustrated by the ways we play with them? ELLIS: Yeah, they can. And I'll come onto that. But first of all, I think - I'm really pleased you brought up the subject of play 'cause for me, it's not an optional extra in cat ownership. It's not a fun thing to do if you have the time. It is as important as feeding them and providing them with a litter box. It's an absolute basic welfare need, particularly for cats that are indoor-only because the cat, as it's evolved and as we've domesticated it and even as we've selectively bred it and got these pedigree cats, we've never selected to get rid of the predatory behavior and the hunting behavior. And so they still have this desire to perform predatory behavior. And in the wild, they would hunt, you know, approximately 10 times a day. So you imagine they've got this instinct to do this behavior. But in an indoor-only environment, they've got no outlet for it. So really for welfare point of view, we have to offer the cat an appropriate outlet and play is a brilliant, brilliant way of doing that because when they play, they're using exactly the same predatory behaviors. The idea that play could be frustrating for a cat really comes from the idea that we are not allowing the cat to express - or an opportunity to do all of the different predatory behaviors. So if you're chasing a laser beam, a little laser light that's produced from a little box or your cat is chasing feathers on the end of a wand, the chase is only one element of the predatory sequence. There is the locate, the stalk, the stare, the chase, the pounce, which is part of the capture, the killing bite and the consume. And so it's important that we, during play and during feeding, we provide opportunity for all of these behaviors, then we're much, much, much less likely to cause any form of frustration. I think we find it quite amusing when we're playing with cats to make sure that the cat actually can't catch the toy that we're playing with, if it's the feathers on a wand, because then they do these beautiful acrobatics for us as they attempt to catch it. GROSS: Exactly, yes (laughter). ELLIS: But it's so, so important we let them catch it because that is the reward, not every time. Remember, this sort of intermittent reinforcement. They wouldn't catch a mouse every time they hunted. They wouldn't be that good. But we need to think to ourselves when playing with cats, let them catch it now and again, especially when we end a play session. End it on a session where they're allowed to capture it and really have a good chew and bite at it. GROSS: So sometimes what's frustrating for the person is that the cat obviously really wants to play. And you get out the wand toy and you start kind of flipping it around, and the cat is spending, like, minutes just kind of watching it intently. And it's like, come on, play. (LAUGHTER) GROSS: Do something (laughter). ELLIS: Yeah. So quite often what's happening there is that the owner is making the pretend prey, so the feathers on the end of the wand, behave in an unrealistic way that a prey item would not normally. So I've never seen a mouse, for example, you know, fly through the air doing 360 degrees. (LAUGHTER) ELLIS: But yet we expect our cats to chase that and capture that. So it's about teaching owners to make sure that a toy on the end of that wand mimics what a mouse or a bird would do. And then you'll find that the cat really gets engaged. And the more they're allowed to capture it - remember they've been rewarded for that behavior - the more they'll think, this is achievable. I can capture this pretend mouse or pretend bird, but to them, it probably feels real at that moment in time. I'm going to have a shot at going for this one because it's within my ream. So it's just about adjusting our expectations a little bit. GROSS: Sarah Ellis, it's been great to talk with you. Thank you so much. ELLIS: Thank you. It's been a pleasure.

npr,"October 27, 2017",'Novitiate' Captures A Watershed Moment In The Life Of The Catholic Church," DAVID BIANCULLI, HOST:  This is FRESH AIR. This past January, Margaret Betts won the breakthrough director award at the Sundance Film Festival for her feature debut ""Novitiate."" It's a coming-of-age story set in the 1960s during the era of reforms in the Catholic Church known as Vatican II. A 17-year-old enters the convent and struggles with herself and the mother superior, who's played by Melissa Leo. Film critic David Edelstein has this review. DAVID EDELSTEIN, BYLINE: The writer-director Margaret Betts has set herself a mighty task for her first feature, ""Novitiate,"" to put us in the heads of young women who long to be brides of Christ. It's the early 1960s when the 17-year-old Cathleen, played by Margaret Qualley, says in voiceover, people never understand why I want to give it all away to God. She tells her mother she's in love and embarks on the year-long training as first a postulant then a novitiate to see if she'll be able to consummate her religious crush. As Betts portrays it, that training is a spiritual boot camp requiring one to forswear human intimacy, observe so-called grand silences in which no one may speak and self-flagellate with a cat-tail whip if one steps out of line. The reverend mother superior, played by Melissa Leo, tells her charges that in their isolation, she will be the lone voice of God. She evinces fierce belief and more than a touch of sadism. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""NOVITIATE"") MELISSA LEO: (As Reverend Mother) Finally, I'd like to talk about silence. We observe two kinds of silence here - regular silence and grand silence. During regular silence, if you feel you have a need to speak, it's permissible. But when you hear that bell at 9 o'clock at night signifying the beginning of grand silence, that means you don't talk. Any questions? Put your hand down, Sister. Postulants don't have questions. And you are free to go home. EDELSTEIN: You could laugh. But the mother superior doesn't wink. She's deadly serious. So is the setting. Bett's palette is full of deep, oppressive but very beautiful blacks that make the characters stand out, as in medieval paintings, and make their flesh that much more vivid. The focus of ""Novitiate"" is twofold on both Cathleen and the mother superior. The question hangs - will Cathleen remain steadfast as other girls are ejected from the order and her mother, Nora, played by Julianne Nicholson, tells her she's insane? It was the violent dissolution of her parents' marriage that kindled the 7-year-old Cathleen's attraction to the Catholic Church. But will that connection hold as she begins to feel more human longings? The second plot line centers on how the mother superior will cope with a seismic shift in church policy in the form of Vatican II, a loosening of laws to which the mother superior is passionately dedicated. She pointedly ignores the new edicts until an archbishop played by Denis O'Hare pays a call. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""NOVITIATE"") DENIS O'HARE: (As Archbishop McCarthy) Tell me - what exactly are you having the most difficulty with? Just lay it all out for me. LEO: (As Reverend Mother) I have no difficulty. I just happen to disagree with it - all of it. Not to mention it's a slap in the face that the sisters weren't given any voice in the matter. O'HARE: (As Archbishop McCarthy) You honestly expected them to have their own voice, the sisters. LEO: (As Reverend Mother) We are a part of this church, too. O'HARE: (As Archbishop McCarthy) Marie, Marie, that's not how it works. LEO: (As Reverend Mother) I don't think you really understand this will do to us. If we were to truly embrace all these changes, it will ruin the very institution of Catholic nuns as... O'HARE: (As Archbishop McCarthy) Are you still encouraging all of your novitiates and postulants to perform extreme acts of penance on themselves, all that old medieval stuff? Because that's got to stop. LEO: (As Reverend Mother) I never asked my girls to do anything for God that I haven't done myself. O'HARE: (As Archbishop McCarthy) Like I said, got to stop. EDELSTEIN: I almost never recognize Melissa Leo. Her features aren't distinctive and transform according to her characters. This is a stunning performance, hateful in many scenes, as when she makes a young woman crawl on her knees for accidentally greeting her during grand silence. In other scenes, Leo's mother superior is so charged with emotion that she seems the purest, most divinely attuned person on screen. There are so many cross currents in ""Novitiate"" that, by the end, I wasn't quite sure if the film was pro- or anti-Vatican II - pro-, I guess, but with the proviso that something vital has been lost. In any case, Cathleen's soul seems to be wandering to settle for a life behind the gates, particularly when she feels a strong connection with a quiet but intense novitiate played by Rebecca Dayan. ""Novitiate"" has some unintentional laughs. Lines are too on the nose, edging into what camp aficionados call nunsploitation. The supporting performances are variable. The score features too many classical religious chestnuts. But Betts has captured a watershed moment in the life of the Catholic Church, a push to adapt that is, in important ways, at odds with its very origins. This young director is off to a terrific start. BIANCULLI: David Edelstein is film critic for New York magazine.

npr,"October 29, 2017",Food Safety After Flooding," No one knows exactly what was in the floodwaters in Texas that came after Hurricane Harvey. That's raised some questions about food safety after a flood. NPR's Hansi Lo Wang reports on the confusion about what to do with crops and farm fields that sat underwater for days. HANSI LO WANG, BYLINE: Alan Gaulding is always trying to keep his rice fields wet, but he says nothing like when Harvey hit. ALAN GAULDING: So it kind of was like a big bowl just full of water. LO WANG: Could you drive on this road before? GAULDING: No. We couldn't even cross the bayou to get here to check on the farm. LO WANG: After the storm came through Hamshire, Texas, about an hour east of Houston, flooding kept him from working the field for almost two weeks. And Gaulding still had a quarter of his rice crop left in the flooded fields, waiting to be harvested. GAULDING: It's like an apple. When it gets too ripe, it falls off the tree - same thing. So we got grain falling off the plant. So we were in a time crunch to get to it. LO WANG: But Gaulding had to wait about three weeks after the storm to find out if his crop would be safe to sell. According to guidance from the Food and Drug Administration, any edible part of a crop exposed to floodwater is not safe for humans to eat because of the risk of bacteria, chemicals, heavy metals and mold. So Gaulding was worried. GAULDING: I'm not growing this food to hurt anybody. I mean, this is thousands of dollars, maybe even $100,000 that I'm going to lose in this field. But it's not worth killing somebody. LO WANG: Gaulding tried to get the state chemist in Texas to test the rice for a possible contamination, but he says it wasn't easy. In a written statement, the state chemist, Tim Herrman, says his office responded to concern about flooded crops, quote, ""accordingly."" But he also confirmed that some of the potential flood contaminants listed by the FDA had not been programmed into his office's computer system before Gaulding's rice was tested. The testing eventually came back negative. No contamination. TED ELKIN: Early on, in any of these events, there's a lot of confusion rumoring about what's actually occurred and what's happening. LO WANG: Ted Elkin is the deputy director for regulatory affairs at the food safety center of the FDA. The agency released a statement in September clarifying that the FDA's guidance did not ban rice or other crops from Texas after Harvey. ELKIN: It really is a general guidance. But we're always trying to make things specific and really on a case-by-case basis. LO WANG: For rice in Texas that touched floodwater after Harvey, Elkin says that means figuring out if the rice sat in pooled rainwater or if floodwater from elsewhere seeped onto the field. Still, the historic levels of rain that fell on Texas are forcing some state officials to rethink how flooding can affect food safety, according to Boone Holladay of the Texas A&amp;M; AgriLife Extension Service. BOONE HOLLADAY: We had water going into places that water has never been before. And so it's kind of rewriting the books for us right now. We're going to have to remap what are going to become areas that are maybe not going to be suitable for specialty crops. LO WANG: As for consumers, Ben Chapman, a food safety specialist at North Carolina State University, says it can be difficult to determine whether the produce at a store have touched floodwater. BEN CHAPMAN: We're at the mercy of the industry in the regulatory world. And the industry every day is producing food for us. LO WANG: It's a responsibility that rice farmer Alan Gaulding says he takes pride in. But he says he's worried about the uncertainty that may come with future floods. GAULDING: There will be a next time. And before we put the farmers through two or three weeks of waiting, we need to think about this thing and say, what happens if it goes underwater? Is it safe? Is it not? LO WANG: Gaulding says he wants to see clearer guidance and a quicker response from the government. What's unclear, more than two months after Harvey hit Texas, is what contaminants may be left in the soil from the flood. So far, neither the Texas Department of Agriculture nor the state health department has tested any farm fields. Hansi Lo Wang, NPR News, Hamshire, Texas. Copyright © 2017 NPR.  All rights reserved.

npr,"October 27, 2017",Too Fast For Safety? Poultry Industry Wants To Speed Up The Slaughter Line," Chickens are carried through a poultry slaughterhouse on mechanical arms. After serving five years in the Navy, Tyler Dunn has returned home to Hickman, Ken. These days, if he isn't at work at the local liquor store or completing assignments for a business degree, you might find him shadowed by one of several stray cats he saved from a parking lot. It's hard to reconcile this image of Dunn — military veteran, serious student and sensitive pet owner — with another fact about his life. Nearly 10 years ago, he was fired by Tyson Foods, in Union City, Tenn., for animal cruelty. ""I worked there for two years before I was let go for 'animal cruelty.' I wouldn't call it animal cruelty,"" says Dunn. He was fired after he appeared in an undercover video recorded by an animal rights group that shows what happens in the part of the plant called the ""live hang."" ""Two people would get beside each other in the front of the line and then they would start hanging, like fast,"" Dunn remembers. He explains the game he and another employee played to see who could hang the most birds: ""So instead of 24 [birds] a minute, which was minimum, we might hit 50 or more a minute — and they called it unnecessary force."" Other employees in the video admit to breaking the backs of birds as they would peck, claw and defecate on workers. It's not the only time animal rights groups infiltrated the company's operations. In an email dated June 2017, Tyson wrote that to increase animal welfare efforts, it has launched the industry's ""most extensive third-party remote video auditing system,"" covering 33 poultry plants, and has taken other measures to improve handling of birds. But industry critics say the underlying problem is the speed at which employees must do their work in plants where 140 birds may go by in a minute. ""I feel like the workers aren't bad people,"" says Debbie Berkowitz, a senior fellow with the worker rights group National Employment Law Project and a former senior official with the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration. She says the higher line speeds increase emotional and physical stress for both workers and animals. ""There is a direct connection. If you make workers work at breakneck speed, they don't really have a choice,"" Berkowitz says. ""The live hang is probably the worst and most disgusting job in America."" Berkowitz is among a group of worker and food safety advocates concerned about a proposal from the poultry industry which would allow an even faster rate of work in parts of some processing facilities. They warn that higher line speeds increase the risks for foodborne illness and worker injuries in an industry that has an already spotty safety record. Greater efficiency The National Chicken Council represents the industry. Spokesperson Tom Super says the motivation behind the higher line speeds is to keep up with international competitors. ""To modernize the system, and really so we can operate more effectively and efficiently,"" he says. In September, the council petitioned the USDA to allow plants that have operated under the New Poultry Inspection System a waiver that would remove the speed limit on some bird processing. Plants operating under that system can now operate as fast as 175 birds per minute. Super says a government pilot program has been operating for almost 20 years, and now plants should be able to do more. ""It has proven safe for the safety of our workers and it has benefited American consumers as well,"" Super says. ""We have science on our side and we have almost 20 years of data. I don't know any other pilot program that has lasted for 20 years."" 'All I could take' The industry waiver targets the part of the plant where organs are removed from the carcasses, called the evisceration line. Super says changing line speeds here would not affect other operations of the plant. Berkowitz and others familiar with the process disagree. ""If they are going to allow 140 birds per minute to whiz by — now they are going to go to 170 or 200 or 250 — that means that many more birds are being killed per hour,"" Berkowitz says. ""Which means live hang has to hang that many more birds."" Berkowitz says this is also where most worker injuries occur. Federal statistics show that animal slaughtering and processing facilities are the 6th most dangerous workplaces for severe injuries. According to a Government Accountability Office report, most musculoskeletal injuries caused by repetitive movement, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, are not reported by workers. Berkowitz says she has interviewed many poultry workers who face that situation. ""They're scared that they're going to get fired if they report an injury or if they file a worker's complaint,"" she says. ""So they just go on unpaid leave and they take care of it themselves."" Paducah, Ken., resident J.T. Crawford says he couldn't imagine trying to work at any part of the plant with higher line speeds. ""I was at the chicken plant for one night. That was about all I could take,"" he says. Crawford said other employees encouraged him, saying he would pick it up eventually. He decided it wasn't worth the risk of injury. ""Night after night after night, pushing your body to the absolute maximum to get these chickens on these lines so that they could be cut,"" Crawford says. Today, Crawford works as an assistant editor for Paducah Life Magazine. Dunn says his two years in the industry were challenging, especially the work in the live hang area. ""In the beginning I was sick, I was weak. It felt like I had the flu,"" he says. ""My body was aching, and from what I understand, from talking to a few people, there were a few folks that had the same symptoms that I did."" He suspected it was due to the foul air strong with the smell of chicken feces and occasionally from rotting dead animals. ""But you get used to it. I got where I couldn't smell myself, but if I got off work other people around me could,"" he says. Dunn also reported injuries to his hands. ""We wore gloves, rubber gloves and then cotton gloves underneath that, but it still wasn't a lot of padding against those shackles,"" he says. Dunn says he missed work because of an infection in a finger that sent him to a doctor. ""They had to cut it open and I was in a hand brace for about a month."" 30 seconds Retired USDA food safety inspector Phyllis McKelvey was stationed at the first plant to pilot the new poultry inspection system in 1999. Today she works with the Government Accountability Project, an advocacy group, speaking out against higher line speeds and the risks for workers and consumers. She says under the new system, only one federal inspector is responsible for viewing birds that come through the evisceration line. ""You had less than 30 seconds to inspect the chicken. How can you look at the front, back, up and down and inside a chicken in 30 seconds?"" McKelvey asks before answering her own question: ""There's no way."" The program is optional and so far only 20 poultry processing plants operate under it. Pilgrim's Pride in Moorefield, W.V., is the only poultry plant in the Ohio Valley region operating under the new inspection system. Federal data on workplace injuries show that facility had five severe injury reports in a two-year period, more than any other facility in the region. In its petition for higher line speeds, the chicken council argues that more plants will choose to operate under the new inspection system if they have the benefit of higher speed and efficiency. McKelvey says the higher the line speed, the less accurate the operation of machines. ""These machines will pull the viscera, which is the guts of the chicken. And a lot of times the guts hang on their prongs and those machines just get covered up in guts, which is slinging manure all over the product,"" she says. In the live hang section, McKelvey said equipment failures would also occur in the stun bath, where birds are shocked with electricity. That would send fully conscious birds to a machine that would sever their necks. ""If the line is going too fast you have a lot of birds that don't get stunned,"" she says. ""So you've got some birds going into the scald vats, alive."" The USDA describes the new inspection system as more science-based in that it requires that all poultry facilities perform their own microbiological testing along with two federal inspectors. This leaves one inspector to view the carcasses. But with fewer inspectors, McKelvey argues, plants are relying on more chemicals like peracetic acid or food bleach to reduce the chance of food contamination. ""And if they don't have a proper air system, these chemicals are causing people to sneeze and cough. And even at that rate it gets so bad we'd have to shut the line down,"" McKelvey says. Process control The National Chicken Council petition says that the requested waivers will depend on a plant's ability to maintain process control. ""We wouldn't operate at any speed limit that we could not maintain process control,"" Super says. ""If a company can't keep its food-safety record straight, if it can't adequately protect its employees, if it can't keep up with sanitation, that would be a loss of process control."" At that point, he says, the USDA would step in. Tyson Foods has two plants operating under the new poultry-inspection system, but has not voiced support for the chicken council petition. In an email, Tyson spokesperson Worth Sparkman says that ""policy and practice encourages plant team members to stop the line at any time for worker or food safety issues."" Sparkman also says that Tyson is committed to achieving a 15 percent reduction in incidents reported to OSHA and to running processes ""at a speed according to the number of people available to work."" OSHA records show that Tyson Foods and Pilgrim's Pride had the highest number of severe injuries reported among animal processors over the past two years, and the companies rank among the top three employers with the highest rates of severe injuries reported. Pilgrim's Pride did not respond to requests for comment for this story. McKelvey says that providing a safe workplace is difficult with the small workforce that the federal government employs to ensure that plants fall in line with the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, which requires plants ""assure safe and healthful working conditions for working men and women."" During a 2015 congressional hearing, OSHA's former director, David Michaels, says his was a small agency. ""With our state partners, we have approximately 2,200 inspectors responsible for the health and safety of 130 million workers employed at more than 8 million work sites around the nation."" That works out to about one compliance officer for every 59,000 workers. Michaels left OSHA at the end of the Obama administration. President Trump has not yet named a replacement. Letter of the law Thirteen groups representing worker rights, consumer safety, public health, and animal welfare met recently with the USDA to urge the agency to reject the poultry industry's effort to increase line speeds. The Southern Poverty Law Center is one of the groups that attended the USDA listening session. In a letter to the USDA, the SPLC says ""in addition to creating bad policy, approving the NCC's petition would violate the law."" The SPLC claims that the USDA is not following the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act, a law that is supposed to keep federal agencies transparent and accountable to the public, because the agency has not published relevant documents on the Federal Register. This has created unease among food safety advocates, because they are uncertain how the USDA plans to approach the rule-making process. A letter from the USDA in response to the National Chicken Council's petition refers to the requested waiver as a policy change. Berkowitz says she is afraid this could result in decision making behind closed doors. The petition is online for public comment until December 13th. A USDA spokesperson said the department's practice is to withhold comment on a petition under consideration.

npr,"October 26, 2017",Celebrity Chef John Besh Leaves Company After 25 Allegations Of Harassment," Sexual misconduct isn't just a Hollywood problem, is not just a problem in media companies or in politics — it's also a problem in the restaurant industry. This week celebrity chef John Besh left his company after it was revealed in an investigation by The Times-Picayune and NOLA.com that 25 women — all current and former employees — said they were victims of sexual harassment while working for the Besh Restaurant Group. Besh is a James Beard winner, owns a dozen restaurants and has a couple of TV shows, but departed after this investigation alleging a culture permissive of harassment was published. Restaurant critic Brett Anderson started investigating the allegations against Besh and his company last February. He joins All Things Considered host Kelly McEvers to talk about how he got started and what he found out after talking to the 25 women who say they were sexually harassed. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. On how the investigation started It was just prompted by a tip I'd heard from a friend, who had told me — it was last February, it was during Mardi Gras season — that a mutual acquaintance of ours had quit her job in the executive office of the Besh Restaurant Group. She told me that she had quit her job in a resignation letter that she emailed to John and his partner, as well as some other managers. And in that email she had alleged that their company harbored a culture of sexual harassment. On the allegations against John Besh himself The 25 women that I mentioned in my story, the great majority of those women, worked in the restaurants that were operated by the Besh Restaurant Group — so those women did not have much interaction with John Besh himself. I did hear complaints about Besh himself, including an [Equal Employment Opportunity Commission] complaint ... a woman who used to work for the Besh restaurant group said she had a sexual relationship with John, and that it was in her words ""unwelcome."" She describes specific instances of being with him on work trips where she felt ... ""overwhelmed,"" was one of the words she used. On sexual harassment in the restaurant industry The great majority of the people that I spoke with had worked in restaurants prior to working at the John Besh Restaurant Group, and almost all of them would tell me something along the lines of ""you know, I got thick skin."" They were saying that working in restaurants, they expected some butt-slapping, they expected to be harassed to a certain degree. I found that sort of striking, because they were in a sense admitting to me that they were going to work every day, assuming they were most likely going to be degraded. But I also asked all of these people if what they experienced at the Besh Group was different than what they experienced elsewhere — and all but a handful, one or two, said that it was a degree worse. On what has happened since the story's publication I have not heard from anyone there in any kind of official capacity. We did confirm that John had stepped down from the day-to-day operations of the company, which to me is the most consequential response. They have hired a human resources professional who started a few weeks before our story was published. But they're suggesting that they're taking the allegations that appeared in the story seriously.

npr,"October 26, 2017",'Healing Through Harvesting': Gleaning Unwanted Fruit Helps Refugees In Need," Tilahun Liben thought he was seeing things. Surely that mound of orange orbs under those trees near his church couldn't be oranges. Could they? It was 2010, and Liben had just arrived in Tucson, Ariz., as a refugee from Ethiopia. He had been a musician, playing saxophone in nightclubs, but that life ended abruptly in 1999 when an oppressive regime imprisoned him for three months for his political dissent. After Liben's release, further persecution forced him to flee his homeland: He ended up at the Kakuma refugee camp, in Kenya, where he waited 10 years to be resettled. Liben, 46, hadn't been in the city more than a few months when he met Barbara Eiswerth, an American who had, by chance, visited Kakuma during Liben's stay. Here in Tucson, Liben learned, Eiswerth had founded an organization called Iskashitaa Refugee Network that helps refugees find community and purpose through gleaning backyard fruit, which they eat themselves and share with other Arizonans in need. Gleaning — or harvesting unwanted fruit — was a new concept to Liben. Then again, so was the sight of oranges and grapefruit piling up beneath trees. ""In Ethiopia, the owner of the tree will get the fruit to the market,"" Liben says. ""And when there was fruit on the ground, people would pick it up and use it. There's no waste."" Within days, Liben was knocking on Iskashitaa's door. Eiswerth started Iskashitaa in 2003, after she mapped Tucson's public fruit as part of her doctoral program in geology — a project that revealed to her the area's edible inventory. Not wanting that bounty to go to waste, she and her colleagues had distributed it at several ""free farmer's markets."" One of these events specifically targeted refugee children, whose enthusiasm for the gleaned fruit blew Eiswerth away. ""I thought, wow, the need is here in this refugee community,""she says. ""Why not teach them about local food resources while teaching them to fit in?"" The produce makes a difference to Tucson's refugees, who despite having an organizational sponsor, often live in poverty. In nearly two decades of working with refugees, Eiswerth, 55, has seen the depth of their talents and skills, but also their hardships. ""I've gone into refugee homes and opened a fridge to see a gallon of milk, a few bottles of water and a few fruits,"" she says. 
                Barbara Eiswerth, founder and director of Iskashitaa, sorts fresh dates gathered by refugees and volunteers in neighborhoods around Tucson, Ariz.

 While Iskashitaa doesn't pay refugees to glean, Eiswerth does whatever she can to help them out — offering gift cards, clothing vouchers, donated toiletries, referrals to grief and trauma programs, and, of course, hundreds of pounds of fruit. Iskashitaa — which means ""working cooperatively together"" in Somali Bantu, the ethnicity of many early volunteers — provides more than just healthy food. It also serves as a refuge and an opportunity for those whose lives have been radically disrupted. ""We provide healing through harvesting,"" Eiswerth likes to say. ""We help refugees belong to something, and we give them a chance to give back to a country that gave them a second lease on life."" For some, that sense of community is as important as Iskashitaa's mission. Faeza Hililian, an Iraqi refugee of Armenian descent, volunteers at Iskashitaa partly because she has the time — she's a retired dentist — and partly to keep her mind occupied. ""I don't like to stay home and think about the past and get sad. Nobody can imagine how in one minute you can lose everything,"" says Hililian, 70, whose family spent more than three years in Syria before being accepted into the United States. Iskashitaa's refugees find the idea of harnessing American excess to feed those in need compelling. The organization rescues 50 tons of produce annually, but that's only about 10 percent of what's locally available. (Nationally, about a third of fruit and vegetables are lost or wasted along the food chain.) 
                Iskashitaa participants, including refugees and volunteers, weigh edible plants they have gathered on a farm.

 ""The waste makes me so sad because a lot of people around the world don't have anything to eat,"" Hililian says. ""I am happy to work to save every food [item], because I think, 'We could use that!' You can make many things out of the fruit and vegetables — juice, pickles, jam. Don't give it to the garbage!"" And so Iskashitaa extends the shelf life of citrus by making jam and converting dates into honey in the commercial kitchen of a local church. It also holds free classes on gardening, cooking, juicing, dehydrating, fermenting, pickling, canning and making fruit syrups, which it sells at farmer's markets. Refugees also coax meals from often-ignored foods. Floyd Gray, a longtime volunteer and fruit donor, said he's learned plenty from having refugees harvest his garden excess. When Iskashitaa sent a few Iraqis to pick grapes from his home arbor, Gray was thrilled to learn that the leaves were also sought to make rice-stuffed dolmades. And he was surprised when a few West Africans harvested his squash leaves. ""They just boiled 'em up and ate them! It's pretty interesting to see other people's cooking styles and what they do with things we never thought were edible,"" says Gray. ""Now, I eat the leaves from cauliflower — I cook it up with collard greens and mustard greens."" But the prime ""use-it-all"" example is the Seville orange, widely planted in Arizona as a decorative tree but ignored as the sour or ""poison orange."" That characterization appalls Iskashitaa volunteers from Iraq, where those oranges are a key culinary component, akin to lemons. ""The sour orange is like medicine,"" says Hililian. ""You can make jam with it, you can do all kinds of things."" Over the years, Iskashitaa, which has an annual operating budget of $100,000, has steadily matured, incorporating the expertise of new participants, both refugees and University of Arizona students from a wide range of programs who flock to intern and volunteer. 
                The bounty at Iskashitaa include jujubes, left, and limes, right.

 The bounty at Iskashitaa include jujubes, left, and limes, right. But the organization's growth hasn't been without friction. Scale has become an issue. Eiswerth recently filled a local pool with citrus to show that the organization was, literally and figuratively, swimming in grapefruit. (A single citrus tree can yield 1,500 pounds of fruit.) Lacking refrigeration, the group stores produce in the shade of its adobe headquarters, where black and green milk crates brim with orange and yellow citrus, and blue tarps house the overflow. ""If someone would like to donate a truck-in or walk-in cooler,"" Eiswerth says, ""that would be great. It's 102 [degrees] outside now."" President Trump's current refugee ban and anti-immigrant rhetoric also pose challenges for an organization working with refugees from five of the original seven blacklisted nations. Eiswerth says that refugees are equally scared and discouraged by developments. But the political turmoil also provides a teachable moment. Since the election, Eiswerth says, ""we have an opportunity to educate and engage more people. Churches who never mentored a refugee family before are now doing it. I think it's profoundly impactful for American-born families to meet a refugee for the first time and experience their life for a minute."" 
                The fruit, nuts and other foods that Iskashitaa participants gather are sometimes dried and processed into jams, syrups and vinegar to raise money for the organization.

 Liben, the Ethiopian musician, feels that his American experience demonstrates that refugees bring more than they take. Despite working full time at a nursing home, he still volunteers at Iskashitaa, occasionally plays saxophone at group events, and serves as a board member. ""All the refugees I know who have come here, they all learned how to work hard. They are living peacefully with no trauma in a free country. They say 'God Bless America,' because America provides a lot for us."" Liben pauses for a moment, and smiles. ""But also, we are the ones who bless America with our hard work.""

npr,"October 26, 2017",The Rise Of Halal Cuisine In An Age Of Islamophobia," It's an evening late in the spring, and the sun is perilously close to setting. I'm getting nervous. Ramadan brings out the Muslim rush when it's time to break our fast, which puts me among the throng outside of Bantam King, a Japanese restaurant in D.C.'s Chinatown where we've all congregated. That's because Bantam King announced on Facebook that it was only serving halal food during the holy month. A friend enters the shop and greets me. ""Hey, assalamu alaikum,"" she says. Gesturing to the people around us she remarks, ""I guess everyone came to try the halal ramen."" Bantam King has made itself a pop-up halal shop — ""Ramendan,"" as the promotion was called. ""Halal"" is often mistaken for a particular type of cuisine, but in fact is the Arabic word for permissible. Halal food, on the other hand, is any type of food that adheres to Islamic dietary prescriptions — free of pork, its byproducts, and alcohol, while meat and poultry must be processed according to Islamic requirements. Historically, finding halal food in North America has been a labor-intensive affair. When I was a child in the early 2000s, my family would have to travel from one end of Toronto to the other if we wanted to eat a halal steak. It's why, back in 1998, Shahed Amanullah created the online halal restaurant guide Zabihah.com, which became a vital tool for people looking to eat halal. ""At the time, I could find only about 200 restaurants through either word of mouth from friends or just searching on the internet,"" Amanullah said. But finding halal food is getting easier: Today, Amanullah's site boasts well over 7,000 entries. It's how I find most of the restaurants where I eat. It's no coincidence that the halal food segment is becoming more profitable: In 2016, Bloomberg reported that sales of halal food in grocery and convenience stories reached $1.9 billion in the U.S., a 15-percent increase from 2012. Globally, in 2015 the halal certified food and beverage market was estimated at $415 billion, according to Thomson Reuters' latest State of the Global Islamic Economy Report. And as many Muslim countries rely on imported food, the U.S. has become a major exporter of halal products. ""As the economy sort of shifts globally, it makes it very appealing to food producers to market halal foods not just domestically but internationally,"" said Salah Hassan, who teaches Arab American and Muslim American studies at Michigan State University. Besheer Mohamed, a senior researcher at Pew, says that the number of U.S. Muslims has been growing steadily, from a relatively small base. ""We now think that 1 percent of the U.S. population is Muslim,"" he says. ""And so as the number of Muslims grow, interest in Muslim-specific products presumably will also rise just by pure numbers."" But halal food isn't catching on just because devout Muslims are eating it: Amanullah says roughly half of his viewers are exclusive halal eaters and the other half are not. The growing popularity of halal food in America runs parallel to a darker trendline: the intensifying of Islamophobia in America. The Pew Research Center recently released its 2017 survey of U.S. Muslims. Roughly half of the participants say they have experienced discrimination, and the share of Muslims who say they have faced at least one instance of religious discrimination has risen modestly. And the numbers seem to bear out these fears: The Council on American-Islamic Relations recorded a 65-percent jump in anti-Muslim bias incidents from 2014 to 2016, and the number of hate crimes in the first half of this year spiked 91 percent over the same period in 2016. This coincided with President Trump's Muslim ban, an executive order meant to bar immigrants and refugees from six majority Muslim countries. So, what gives? Krishnendu Ray, who chairs the department of nutrition and food studies at New York University, pointed to similar examples in communities that endured broad suspicion even as their cuisines became widely sought and consumed. He pointed to the prevailing anti-German sentiment during and immediately after World War I which, strangely, came at the same time as a surge in the market for German food — although the food was often renamed to make it more palatable. (This is how frankfurters became hot dogs.) You could see the same phenomenon play out for Chinese people, a group for whom contempt ran so deep that in 1882 the government formally forbade them from immigrating to the U.S. But by World War II, anti-Chinese sentiment existed simultaneously with the chop suey craze. And Ray says that while large parts of the population had disdain and disgust toward Chinese food, there was also a kind of excitement about something ""exotic"" and different. Ray calls this idea ""culinary colonialism"": a mode of acquiring cultural capital — and the idea of worldliness and cool points — by consuming everything. The colonizer seizes the social assets of a person by claiming something like their cultural foods. ""This omnivorousness is related to consuming the other,"" he says, ""other"" in this sense meaning the group being colonized. ""Just because you are consuming something doesn't mean you have any particular respect for that other."" But Amanullah, the founder of Zabihah, attributes some of the interest in halal food to the current political situation — consuming halal food in a kind of demonstration of one's political beliefs. ""This was very much driven by a reverse Trump effect — because of the highlighted attention towards Muslims in the wake of Muslim ban,"" he said. ""American communities and businesses are wanting to show their solidarity and support for their Muslim neighbors."" Ray says that because the U.S. is starting at such a low baseline regarding halal cuisine, any increase in the consumption can look like a huge uptick in growth. Ironically, Ray says such an increase can also drive Islamophobia. Anthropologists call it the fear of small numbers — the growth of the halal market becomes evidence of an explosion of Muslim-ness and fuels conspiracy theories about the impending imposition of sharia law. Amanullah says he sees a little of this with people who are hostile to Muslims using his Zabihah website as a guide for places to avoid. There have also been a few franchisees of bigger companies that offer halal but who've asked to be removed from his database. ""The franchises that don't want to be labelled on my site, they tend to be headquartered in parts of the country where Islamophobia is more of a problem,"" he said. And then there are the restaurants that have faced a little bit of backlash but realize it's a choice: between a few trolls harassing them on Facebook or bolstering their bottom line. Bantam King is a great example of that, Amanullah says. ""They didn't expect nearly the amount of attention they got, but every night at 8:30 they were packed,"" he said. ""They basically had two dinner rushes."" Whether halal food will become a relatively mainstream designation, like kosher food, remains to be seen. Ray says he is uncertain whether Islamophobia will allow for that to happen, while Amanullah is more optimistic. He says that where food goes, people will follow, and he hopes halal food will be one of those things that normalizes the American Muslim presence in America. So what does all this mean for Muslims like me? As I sat in Bantam King that day in Ramadan, at the counter because there was no other available seating, I heard a waiter tell the cooks that sunset was at 8:28 p.m. That was the time for breaking fast that day, so the Muslim patrons would want their meals by then. I was used to meticulously counting down the minutes till sunset, but here I was in this restaurant in the U.S. — and for the first time in my life the non-Muslim people around me were doing the same. I don't expect food will single-handedly save us all from bigotry. But at least now I can vent over a bowl of halal ramen today, and halal who-knows-what-else in the years to come.

npr,"October 26, 2017",Monsanto Attacks Scientists After Studies Show Trouble For Weedkiller Dicamba," In a normal year, Kevin Bradley, a professor of weed science at the University of Missouri, would have spent his summer testing new ways to control a troublesome little plant called water hemp. This has not been a normal year. ""I don't even talk about weed management anymore,"" Bradley tells me, and he sounds disgusted. ""Nobody calls me and ask me those questions. I barely have time to even work with my graduate students. Everything is about dicamba. Every single day."" Dicamba, an old weedkiller that is being used in new ways, has thrust Bradley and a half-dozen other university weed scientists into the unfamiliar role of whistleblower, confronting what they believe are misleading and scientifically unfounded claims by one of the country's biggest seed and pesticide companies: Monsanto. ""It's not comfortable. I'm like anybody else, I don't like [it when] people are unhappy with me,"" says Mike Owen, a weed specialist at Iowa State University. Then he chuckles. ""But sometimes, like John Wayne said, a man's got to do what a man's got to do!"" ""Certainly, there's not a weed scientist in any of these states who would back down, who would change their story,"" says Aaron Hager, at the University of Illinois. The tensions between Monsanto and the nation's weed scientists actually began several years ago, when Monsanto first moved to make dicamba the centerpiece of a new weedkilling strategy. The company tweaked the genes in soybeans and cotton and created genetically modified varieties of those crops that can tolerate doses of dicamba. (Normally, dicamba kills those crops.) This allowed farmers to spray the weedkiller directly on their soybean or cotton plants, killing the weeds while their crops survived. It's an approach that Monsanto pioneered with crops that were genetically modified to tolerate glyphosate, or Roundup. After two decades of heavy exposure to glyphosate, however, devastating weeds like Palmer amaranth, or pigweed, developed resistance to it. So farmers are looking for new weedkilling tools. Dicamba, however, has a well-known defect. It's volatile; it tends to evaporate from the soil or vegetation where it has been sprayed, creating a cloud of plant-killing vapor that can spread in unpredictable directions. It happens more in hot weather, and Monsanto's new strategy inevitably would mean spraying dicamba in the heat of summer. Monsanto and two other chemical companies, BASF and DuPont, announced that they had solved this problem with new ""low-volatility"" formulations of dicamba that don't evaporate as easily. Yet the companies — especially Monsanto — made it difficult for university scientists to verify those claims with independent tests before the products were released commercially. ""I wish we could have done more testing. We've been asking to do more testing for several years, but the product was not made available to us,"" says Bob Scott, a weed scientist at the University of Arkansas. ""These are proprietary products. Until they release those formulations for testing, we're not allowed to [test them]."" To make matters worse, Monsanto started selling its new dicamba-tolerant soybeans in 2016, before the new low-volatility formulations of dicamba were even approved for sale. It tempted farmers to use older versions of dicamba on these crops, illegally, and some farmers couldn't resist that temptation. In Arkansas, there were widespread reports that dicamba was damaging neighboring fields that didn't have the benefit of Monsanto's new genes. In one case, a dispute between farmers led to a fatal shooting. That fall, at a meeting of weed scientists, Hager confronted Monsanto's representatives. According to Hager, he told the company that ""you knowingly released these varieties in an area of the U.S. where you knew that glyphosate resistance [in weeds] was rampant. When you did that ... you knew what was going to happen."" ""I got a blank stare,"" Hager recalls. This past summer, the floodgates on dicamba use opened. The new formulations of dicamba were approved for use (although Arkansas only allowed farmers to use BASF's product, not Monsanto's) and farmers rushed to adopt the new technology. They planted dicamba-tolerant crops on 26 million acres. 
                A farmer's nightmare weed, glyphosate-resistant Palmer amaranth, or pigweed, sprouts in a soybean field in Arkansas. Its evolution has farmers looking for new weedkilling strategies.

 ""The demand for it is overwhelming. The need to control these difficult-to-manage weeds is huge,"" says Scott Partridge, Monsanto's vice president of global strategy. When spraying started, complaints rolled in. The new ""low volatility"" versions of dicamba didn't stay where they belonged. They drifted into nearby fields, damaging crops there — mostly soybeans, but also vegetables and orchards. There were reports of damage from Mississippi to Minnesota, but the problem was worst in Arkansas, Missouri and Tennessee. ""By the end of May, first of June, it became impossible; the calls were coming in, three or four a day. Sometimes eight or 12 a day,"" says the University of Arkansas' Scott. ""There is no precedent for what we've seen this year."" At first, the companies selling these herbicides — both Monsanto and BASF — seemed unconcerned. ""All I got was denial that there was a problem,"" Bradley says. ""What I kept hearing was: It's not a big problem nationwide; we always have these kinds of mistakes or accidents with the introduction of any new technology."" So Bradley, a past president of the Weed Science Society of America, started collecting data on crop damage from across the country, mapping the epidemic. By the end of the summer, Bradley estimated that at least 3.1 million acres of crops had shown some injury from drifting dicamba. With the scale of dicamba damage increasingly clear, a fierce debate erupted over its cause. Monsanto's executives insist that the people who sprayed dicamba were just learning how to do it properly and didn't follow directions. Partridge says his company checked out more than a thousand cases of dicamba damage, ""and in 88 percent of those instances, the label was not followed."" Farmers or pesticide applicators sprayed dicamba too close to neighboring fields, didn't clean out their equipment properly or used the wrong nozzles. ""Every one of those [mistakes] is fixable by education,"" Partridge says. University weed scientists say that that is only part of the explanation and that the problem can't be fixed so easily. Bradley, Scott and their colleagues in other states say that much of the damage they saw this year didn't appear to come from ""physical drift"" of windblown droplets of dicamba, coming directly from a sprayer. Physical drift, they say, typically produces a plume of damage that diminishes with distance from the source of the spray. Instead, they saw entire hundred-acre fields of soybeans with cupped leaves, and the damage was uniform from one end to the other. They also saw damage in orchards and fields that were far removed from any fields sprayed with dicamba. This pattern, they say, looks more like what they had feared all along: volatilization. 
                Lyle Hadden, a soybean farmer, holds leaves and a stalk from a soybean plant in a field he planted that shows signs of being affected by dicamba.

 What is more, the scientists say, field experiments that they finally carried out this summer point toward evaporating dicamba as a cause. Bob Scott shows me one such experiment, a field of soybeans at a research station near Lonoke, Ark. Here, soybeans were injured by dicamba that definitely did not enter the field through mistakes in spraying. ""It's important to remember, we did not spray this plot,"" Scott says. Instead, at a location far away from this field, he and his colleagues sprayed trays of soil with various dicamba-containing herbicides. Then they carried the trays into this field and placed them between the rows of soybeans for 48 hours. The trays and soybeans were protected underneath plastic hoops — essentially, miniature greenhouses — that were open at each end. The dicamba evaporated from the trays and injured the soybean plants nearby, curling their leaves and stunting their growth. ""A lot of people were very disappointed when they saw the plots,"" Scott says. ""A lot of people didn't want to see what they were seeing, and were in disbelief."" These observations have huge implications. If the new formulations of dicamba evaporate and spread, they cannot easily be controlled. ""If this were any other product, I feel like it would be just pulled off the market, and we'd be done with it,"" Scott says. But dicamba, and the crops created to tolerate it, aren't just any products. There is big money behind them. Monsanto, seed dealers, farmers who are struggling with weed problems — they all have a stake in this technology. The university scientists who are pointing out problems with them are confronting an economic juggernaut.  Monsanto — and farmers who want to use dicamba — have been fighting back. In Arkansas, where state regulators proposed a ban on dicamba during the growing season next year, Monsanto recently sued the regulators, arguing that the ban was based on ""unsubstantiated theories regarding product volatility that are contradicted by science."" The company called on regulators to disregard information from Jason Norsworthy, one of the University of Arkansas' weed researchers, because he had recommended that farmers use a non-dicamba alternative from a rival company. Monsanto also attacked the objectivity of Ford Baldwin, a former university weed scientist who now works as a consultant to farmers and herbicide companies. ""I read it as an attack on all of us, and anybody who dares to [gather] outside data,"" Scott says. ""And some of my fellow weed scientists read it that way as well."" Bradley says executives from Monsanto have made repeated calls to his supervisors. ""What the exact nature of those calls [was], I'm not real sure,"" Bradley says. ""But I'm pretty sure it has something to do with not being happy with what I'm saying."" I contacted three academic deans at the University of Missouri, asking for details about the calls. A university spokesman said they were too busy to respond. Monsanto's Partridge says, ""We are not attacking Dr. Bradley. We respect him, his position, opinion, and his work. We respect him, and academics in general."" Bradley says criticism from people in Missouri's farming community whom he has known for years hits him even harder. ""To have somebody say that what [I'm] saying is bad for Missouri agriculture, that's a hard one to take,"" he says. ""There's not a lot of glory in these positions, or major financial incentive. We chose these jobs to help the farmers in our states."" Monsanto's explanation for what happened this summer, and how to prevent it, seems to be carrying the day in Washington, D.C. Two weeks ago, the Environmental Protection Agency announced that it will allow continued use of dicamba next year. The EPA is imposing a few additional restrictions on who can spray it, and when. Those restrictions will have little effect, or none at all, on damage caused by volatilization. Arkansas' proposal to ban use of dicamba during the growing season next summer has not yet received final approval. A public hearing on the proposal is set for Nov. 8. Kevin Bradley thinks there is one positive result from the controversy. ""It has made more farmers aware of what we do, and that is, unbiased research and calling it like we see it,"" he says. Over the course of recent decades, publicly funded agricultural extension services have shrunk, and farmers have turned to seed and chemical companies for advice. ""It's become so weighted towards — 'well, the companies did their research, and it said this, so that must be the way it is!' "" Bradley says. ""You know what? Maybe that's not the way it is."" A headline on a previous version of this story incorrectly suggested dicamba is a new weedkiller. It is actually an old product being used in a new strategy.

npr,"October 26, 2017",Water Spinach Farmers Struggle To Recover After Hurricane Harvey," Water spinach goes by many other names. A staple among some Asian-American families for stir-frys and soups, this stalky vegetable with arrowhead leaves and hollow stems is known as ong choy in Cantonese and rau muống in Vietnamese. But in a Cambodian-American community tucked down the gravel roads of Rosharon, Texas — about a half-hour south of Houston — most people call it by its Khmer name, trakoun. Often sold in the produce section of Asian-owned supermarkets around the country, the vegetable is the main source of income for many families in Rosharon.

 A highly regulated, invasive plant, water spinach is grown in greenhouses in Rosharon, Texas. This country town is one of the few parts of the U.S. where water spinach is grown commercially. The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department has issued more than 50 active permits in Rosharon for growing water spinach, a highly regulated, invasive plant that the federal government considers a noxious weed, making it illegal to sell across state lines without a permit. But almost two months after Hurricane Harvey and historic flooding totaled many of their homes and damaged their water spinach greenhouses, the farmers are still recovering, worried about what will happen to their way of life. Before Harvey, Sok Sum and his wife, Sreyaun Pin, would often spend early morning hours crouched inside the three greenhouses behind their home, each more than half a football field long. Harvesting water spinach inside the plastic-covered greenhouses too late in the day could mean getting heat stroke, Sok says. ""This is hard work. When you see stuff at the store, the vegetables, you don't know how hard work over here is,"" he adds.

 Water spinach farmers in Rosharon, Texas, are worried about the fallen beams and torn plastic sheeting for their greenhouses as winter approaches. With a meat cleaver from his kitchen in his left hand, he would whack close to the water spinach vines snaking across the greenhouse's dirt floor, cutting down stems sprouting just below his knee. In about two hours, Sum and his wife would fill a 25-pound box with small green bouquets of bunched-up water spinach to sell to a local supermarket or wholesaler. In a week, they could earn about $300 to add to the disability benefits Sum has been receiving since he was injured in a welding accident at a factory job. But Sum says he hasn't been farming since Harvey, and the flooding turned his home into a ramshackle shell. It took about a week before the water receded in Rosharon and he and his neighbors could return to their houses. ""When I opened the door, I was crying,"" Sum says. Pin, Sum's wife, says donations from churches and volunteer groups have helped them survive since Harvey. They and other families have been replenishing their supplies with donated bottled water, baby formula and other essentials stacked around the temple altar of the nearby Buddha Raksmey Monastery. ""Now, it's better, but [we] still need help,"" Pin says. They lived in a tent in their front yard with their 10-year-old daughter for weeks, waiting for their house to dry out. In black marker, Sum wrote above the tent flap: ""We are strong here."" But finding snakes on their property convinced them to move back into their house, even though it was still damp inside and some rooms smelled moldy. Now, Pin says they and many of their neighbors are worried about the fallen beams and torn plastic sheeting for their water spinach greenhouses.

npr,"October 25, 2017","Remembering Cornelia Walker Bailey, A Giant Of Gullah Geechee Culture"," On the coastal edge of Georgia sits a small, dwindling community known as the Gullah Geechee. The people in the community are direct descendants of enslaved West Africans who settled on the barrier islands there. The Gullah Geechee's unofficial historian and vocal advocate for the preservation of the community, Cornelia Walker Bailey, has died. She was 72. Bailey died on Oct. 15 in Brunswick, Ga. She was considered the Geechee ""griot,"" a West African term for oral historian or storyteller, and fought to keep alive the community's history and way of life, especially its food culture. She believed the cultivation and sale of an heirloom legume would ultimately help save the Geechee, who had been facing especially hard financial times in the last few years. Bailey belongs to the last generation of Geechee who were born, raised, and schooled on Sapelo Island. She published a memoir about growing up Geechee called God, Dr. Buzzard, and the Bolito Man, as well as a cookbook, and started a guest lodge on the island. In 2004, Bailey won a Governor's Award in Humanities for her preservation work.  In an essay, ""I am Sapelo,"" Bailey wrote about her life's work: ""We don't want to lose the meaning of what a lot of gnats mean, how fresh-dug sweet potatoes taste cooked in hot ashes. I am Sapelo and all the hundreds of others who are descendants; we who remain here is Sapelo."" Her reminiscences on food colored a deep and sometimes desperate South: ""Papa would ... cook hominy grits for us. That was his treat, cooking hominy grits for us. Papa provided for us the best he could. We had alligator dishes along with pork greens. We had game birds and shore birds - wild turkey and gannet. We had fish of all kinds, we had turtle of all kinds. We had deer, squirrel, rabbit, raccoon, and possum. Some only in season, some by means of poaching. Sometimes nothing at all."" Bailey was a so-called ""saltwater Geechee,"" the colloquialism for people from Sapelo. The island is home to the last remaining enclave of Geechee, Hog Hammock. Most of the island is owned by the state of Georgia, so there is no official population count, but in 2008, Bailey told NPR that only around 60 people remained. And those that do live on the island, or own property there, faced skyrocketing property taxes — threatening not just the ability for people to live on the island, but the viability of the culture. In a conversation with NPR's Michele Martin in 2013, Bailey said that a lot of the descendants sold their property for profit, and that was having a negative effect: ""You know, there's always somebody out there who wants something, and if they want something and they can afford it, then they're going to buy it,"" she told NPR. ""And if you buy an acre of land for $250,000, naturally you going to build a house to reflect the price that you paid for the land."" As a way to raise revenue and address the high taxes, Bailey started the Red Pea Project, pushing for the commercialization of Sapelo red peas. The peas are an heirloom legume originally brought from Sierra Leone by enslaved Africans and cultivated on Sapelo. Bailey saw the production and sale of red peas as a way for the community to invest and connect to their heritage and land. Bailey's son Stanley Walker told the Southern Foodways Alliance  that Sapelo red beans are married to their location. ""A lot of people say they have the original (pea),"" he said. ""Once you take it from Sapelo and plant it, it's not the original. You done changed the genealogy of the pea."" Bailey, her husband and two sons built a guest lodge called ""The Wallow,"" offering history tours of Sapelo. She was also a driving force in creating a 25-acre Geechee educational center and retreat, which is not yet operating. And while Bailey's legacy is well-documented and will live on, her passing raises the question as to whether the dwindling of the unique Geechee Gullah will quicken. There is no school there; the last one shuttered nearly 40 years ago.   Despite dedicating her life to its preservation, Bailey resigned herself to the difficulty of keeping the Geechee culture alive when there are not many descendents left on the island. Many Sapelo residents have left because of the property tax increases over the last several years or in search of education and more opportunity. ""Culture is no good without land,"" she told NPR in 2008, ""We're holding onto the land, so we can hold on to the culture.""

npr,"October 25, 2017",The Trick To Making Your Own Halloween Candy? Swallowing Your Fear," In her book, Candy is Magic: Real Ingredients and Modern Recipes, Curl crafts caramels and gumdrops and lollipops out of everything from roasted fruit to simmered-down wine to cream infused with freshly popped corn. Because it turns out that — despite what you might think from looking in a Halloween basket — candy can be made from actual ingredients. Real Ingredients, Modern Recipes by Jami Curl Hardcover, 303 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? But evangelizing homemade candy requires a bit of a public education campaign. Not only do most people think you can't make candy from real ingredients — they don't think the average person can make candy at all.  ""I think it's scary to some people, because it's really hot, and it involves a thermometer. People don't want to do things that are fussy,"" observes Curl. And candy is different from other types of kitchen magic. Bake a cake a bit too long, or over-salt your soup, and you can still redeem things — trim off the burnt edges and slather on some frosting, or toss in a few handfuls of rice (respectively), and all is redeemed. But bring your sugar to the wrong temperature, and you may be left with caramels that turn to goo, or candies that could break your teeth. That transformation can be a bit unforgiving and intimidating. But also kind of magical. ""That is the wizardry behind it,"" laughs Curl. ""You put stuff in a pot that is a liquid, but then you make a candy that stands up on a stick. That is pretty powerful, I have to say. Those things that take the biggest journey are the things people get the most excited about."" But, Curl acknowledges, you do have to be careful. ""Making candy is all about controlling sugar."" And that control comes down to bringing it to precise temperatures (thermometers are required for a lot of candy-making), measuring ingredients carefully (candy requires accuracy, so grab a digital scale), as well as finessing its physical structure. ""As soon as you melt it, sugar wants to become a crystal,"" Curl explains.

 Curl's fruity Dreams Come Chew candies Remember making rock candy as a kid? With all those crystals magically ""growing"" around a string from a dissolved sugar solution? That's what we're talking about. To make sure sugar doesn't re-crystalize when you don't want it to, you have to be careful about handling it — swirl, don't stir (which would encourage the sugar to re-bond to itself). Many candy recipes also use an ""interfering agent"" that keeps the sugar from turning back to a crystal — usually glucose, though corn syrup can do the trick in a home kitchen. This can be a bit intimidating — nobody wants to have a flop in the kitchen. ""You have invested your time,"" Curl notes, ""which is priceless for everyone. And then you have invested in ingredients. And then you screw it up. And that fear is what keeps people from experimenting."" But, Curl stresses, that experimentation doesn't need to be scary. Really, it's just a recipe. ""All candy starts out the same. You put the sugar in a pot, and then you melt it. And depending on what temp you cook it to, it does different things. Low temperature equals soft, chewy candy. If you cook it to a high temperature, it caramelizes, and gets to a hard-crack stage."" And, if you're Curl, you then use that structure of carefully controlled sugar, and fill it with big, natural flavors. At Quin, they craft lollipops made of fruit and wine, caramels flavored with coffee and popcorn. And, Quin stresses, it's pretty easy to get the flavors in there. While sugar that's taken to the hard-crack stage (like a lollipop) will burn off a lot of the subtle flavors, for many confections, you can get some amazing results from simple ingredients. ""In caramel, for example, cream is a really good vehicle for getting flavor into the candy. You can pour hot cream over popcorn, let it sit, then strain it, and the cream itself tastes like popcorn. And that carries through right until you unwrap it,"" says Curl. She uses this same infuse-the-cream technique with everything from orange zest to black peppercorns. And fruit — fresh or frozen — lends a note to everything from gumdrops to marshmallows (after a quick roasting in the oven, to remove moisture and concentrate the flavor and color). Curl still remembers the first time they succeeded in such a recipe. ""To take blackberries that we'd picked, and in a few hours, get them to stand up as a lollipop on a stick — it was this other world for me. I still wholeheartedly believe it's magic."" But, Curl, stresses, getting flavor from all these foods does not mean you're ending up with some sort of health food. We're still talking sugar, after all — it's still a treat. But there is a space in life for treats. And a treat you can make yourself — from real ingredients? That's also quite a trick.

 Curl's Popcorn Caramel Makes about 115 caramels if made in a pan Without a doubt, this candy combines a pair of great flavors: caramelized sugar and salty popcorn. The popcorn is introduced into the candy in two ways. First, a popcorn infused cream that basically tastes like popcorn-flavored milk; and second, a layer of popped corn that's pressed directly into the caramel after it's cooked and poured, so that each little square of candy is studded with a kernel or two. Between the flavor and the texture, it's hard to decide what I like best. When the caramel has set, see pages 164 to 165 for cutting tips, detailed instructions, and illustrations.   Ingredients: 438 grams glucose syrup 800 grams granulated sugar 265 grams Popcorn Cream (see below) 7 grams kosher salt 18 grams vanilla extract 295 grams unsalted butter, cut into roughly 1-inch pieces 90 grams Every Day, Popcorn (see below) Lightly butter a 9 by 13 –inch pan. Weigh the glucose syrup directly into a heavy-bottomed pot, then set the pot over medium-high heat. Allow the glucose to warm until it liquefies and then starts to bubble. Once the glucose has bubbled a bit in one spot, swirl the pot to distribute the heat. Add the sugar, about one-third at a time, sprinkling it over the glucose syrup. Using a high-heat spatula or wooden spoon, poke (no stirring) the sugar down into the syrup after each addition. Keep watch to make sure no giant lumps of dry sugar remain before you add the next installment of sugar. If you see lumps, poke them down into the glucose. Once all of the sugar is added and has been poked down into the liquid so it's wet, stop poking. Pour the cream into a small saucepan and add the salt and vanilla. Stir to mix, then set the pan over low to medium heat. You're not looking to boil the cream; the idea is to simply warm the ingredients so they're not cold when they go into the hot sugar. Meanwhile, let the glucose and sugar cook, swirling the pot occasionally, until the mixture is dark amber, or the color of a copper penny. Time-wise, you're looking at 13 to 15 minutes for the caramel to reach the target color. At first the sugar will turn pale brown, then darker brown. This may happen in spots around the pot, so it's important to swirl the pot as the sugar cooks. Once the sugar is a uniform color, cook it for a second or two longer until you feel good about the color, remembering that you want it to match that dark amber target. Remove the pot from the heat and very carefully add the warmed cream mixture, immediately followed by the butter. Whisk the candy for 5 minutes, until completely emulsified. This means that the fats have been completely mixed into the sugar with no chance of separating. The mixture will be homogenized, with no oily separation or bits of anything burnt floating around. Pour the caramel into the prepared pan, nudging it into the corners as needed, and allow it to rest for 5 minutes. Shower the popcorn evenly over the top (see below) and press down lightly to ensure a good stick. Allow the candy to sit until cooled and set, at least 3 hours or preferably up to overnight, before cutting. Topping The Caramel When topping a slab of candy with an ingredient, whether it's salt, popcorn, seeds, sprinkles, coconut, or shards of chocolate, it's important to shower it from a good height, rather than just an inch or so above the candy. Don't believe me? Try it. Grab a few fingers full of salt and attempt to sprinkle them all over something from an inch or so away. See what happens? The salt all ends up in one big pile. Now, do it again, but sprinkle the salt from 18 inches above the surface. This time the salt is distributed much more evenly, and you've avoided getting too much in any one spot. Knowing how to shower any ingredient is important because you will be sprinkling it on hot candy — and you can't correct your mistake once the sprinkling is done. Makes about 270 grams Probably what I love the most about popcorn cream is the fact that if you drink it, it tastes like buttered popcorn or a night out at the movies. (But who would drink heavy cream? Anyone? Only me? OK.) You need a food processor for this recipe, and the bowl and the blade of the processor must be completely dry. You want to turn the popcorn into dust, and that won't be possible if there's any moisture around. One more thing: the popcorn in this recipe is popcorn you'll pop yourself on the stove top. I'm always surprised by the number of people who use a microwave to make popcorn when the stove-top method (especially when popped in coconut oil and a little sugar) produces such superior results. You may be tempted to make this cream with prepopped bagged stuff or even a chemical-laden microwave imposter, but the flavor will never be the same. Ingredients: 100 grams Every Day, Popcorn (see below) 500 grams heavy cream Place the popcorn in the bowl of a food processor fitted with the blade attachment. Pulse the popcorn until it turns into a fine dust. Empty the popcorn dust into a heatproof bowl. Pour the cream into a small saucepan, place over medium heat, and bring to a gentle boil, stirring a couple of times while you're waiting. Once the cream is bubbling, immediately pour it over the popcorn dust, nudging with a spoon to make sure that every speck of dust is saturated with cream. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and allow the cream to steep for 30 minutes. Set a fine mesh strainer over a small bowl and pour the cream-popcorn mixture into the strainer. It will look like some kind of mush, but it will smell like cream and popcorn (and, if you're like me, you'll start to get excited). Press the popcorn mush against the strainer with the back of a large spoon to release as much of the beautiful cream as you can. Discard the mush. The cream is now ready to use, or transfer it to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 1 week. Makes about 300 grams The real goal here is popcorn that can be used to make popcorn and cream, the key ingredient in Popcorn Caramels.. I pop my corn in refined coconut oil because the oil can stand up to high heat. Beware! Once the aroma of freshly popped popcorn fills your home, a snack attack is inevitable. You are going to needs 100 grams of the popcorn for making the cream and another 90 grams or so for topping the caramels. The remaining popcorn? Snack away. And don't be surprised if you're tempted to make this popcorn every day. Ingredients: 114 grams coconut oil 230 grams popcorn kernels (white or yellow) 75 grams granulated sugar 10 grams kosher salt Put the coconut oil in a large pot (with the lid nearby), set it on the stove top, and turn the burner to medium-high. Once the coconut oil has liquefied, sprinkle the popcorn kernels evenly over the oil, then sprinkle the sugar evenly over the kernels. Place the lid on the pot and wait for the kernels to start popping. While you are waiting, get out a sheet pan and put it near the stove. Once the popcorn is off to a start, stand by and listen. You'll want to keep the pot on the heat until there are long pauses between pops. Those pauses should not last more than 10 seconds. As soon as the popping starts to slow, turn off the burner, take the pot off the heat, carefully remove the lid, and pour the popcorn onto the sheet pan. Sprinkle the salt all over the popped corn. The popcorn is ready to use, and (once cool) can be stored in an airtight container for up to 1 week. Reprinted with permission from Candy is Magic, copyright 2017 by Jami Curl.

npr,"October 24, 2017",Wine Organization Forecasts Historically Bad Year Due To Weather Events," World wine production is having a historically bad year. Europe, home to the world's leading wine producers, is making wine at significantly lower levels than usual – and that's because of ""extreme weather events"" such as frost and drought that have damaged vineyards, according to the International Organization of Vine and Wine (OIV). The intergovernmental wine organization says this year's output is projected to be the lowest in more than 50 years, according to the BBC and Reuters. It is projecting that 246.7 million hectoliters will be produced this year globally, a drop of 8.2 percent compared to last year. The situation is bleakest in the three countries that produce the most wine – Italy (down by 23 percent), France (down by 19 percent) and Spain (down by 15 percent).

 Earlier this month, Thierry Coste of the Copa-Cogenca farmer's union told reporters that this is ""the lowest (European) harvest that we have seen since World War II,"" according to Agence France-Presse. Coste added that climate change has badly affected the vineyards, causing producers to harvest grapes early. ""The quality of the grape is nevertheless expected to be very good across Europe which should make for an excellent wine,"" he said, according to the wire service. Some small producers are having to make difficult choices. Rupert Millar, fine wine editor of industry journal The Drinks Business, told the BBC that they ""are facing the very real problem of having to sell family domains because, unless the banks are going to help them in some way, they're stuck."" He added: ""But just how many this is happening to is another question."" Other European countries that produce comparatively less wine saw small rises, including Portugal, Romania, Hungary and Austria. U.S. wine production levels were down marginally, about one percent from last year. However, it's worth noting that the estimate is based on USDA forecasts from August, the OIV stated, and ""does not therefore take into account the potential consequences of the recent fires in California."" The wildfires devastated California wine country, though the full extent of the damage to wineries is still unclear. The Napa Valley Vintners association said 47 member wineries reported damage, but added that the wine industry damages in the area ""do not appear to be widespread."" The situation is less bleak in other wine-producing areas. South America is expected to show an increase, driven by a 25 percent increase in Argentina, the OIV said. Brazil also saw improvement after low production in 2016. The levels in South Africa rose about 2 percent compared to the previous year. The wine organization says it expects world wine consumption in 2017 to rise from 240.5 to 245.8 hectoliters. That's a level just shy of the expected production. These market forces, the BBC writes, ""could raise prices and dissipate a global surplus caused by a demand slump in the wake of the financial crisis.""

npr,"October 24, 2017",Can Science Change The Mildewed Fortunes Of New York Heritage Hops?," Some might consider the scraggly vines often spotted snaking up porch trellises in New York's Schoharie County a nuisance. But there are some vine-like plants in this region that have a deep importance to the area — and signify promise for the future of local agriculture. Hops helped make vast fortunes for farmers and brewers in New York state in the 19th century. Then, around 1910, a mildew blight ushered in their swift demise. There have been unsuccessful attempts to revive them ever since Prohibition ended in 1933. Now, 14 biotech students at the State University of New York (SUNY) in Cobleskill are working to engineer fungus-resistant hop varietals native to New York, itching for a role in the revival of the state's historic craft beer industry. The hope is to stave off another disease-borne calamity — or at least, make the local growing of heritage hops less of a hardship. ""The way we're working with hops — it's very new,"" says chemistry professor Lynda McMaster-Schuyler, who helps oversee the initiative. Labs elsewhere have been working to develop mildew-resistant strains native to other places. But, McMaster-Schuyler says, the effort to revive the traditional New York hops is ""completely original to us. And the fact that these hops are right in our backyard — that's the beauty beyond the science."" Developing mildew-resistant hops would be a boon to the area's 120 hops farmers — and others deciding whether planting this lucrative but troublesome commodity is worth the risk. In the Cobleskill lab, a stack of Petri dishes contain sections of hop shoots, called internodes, growing in clear gel. Some of the dishes show splotches of white or orange, telltale signs of mildew infestation. But a few are clean and have begun developing the calluses — basically, masses of new cells — needed to initiate the next, genetic-engineering portion of the research. In 2016, McMaster-Schuyler launched the hops project at Cobleskill, an agricultural college, as a way to support efforts to boost the state's farming economy. She was inspired, she says, by Gov. Andrew Cuomo's 2012 Farm Brewery License, which gives small brewers who agree to use locally grown ingredients like hops and barley (20 percent to start, 60 percent by 2019, 90 percent by 2024) a tax benefit, among other financial incentives.

 Buckets of hops plants, some of which were provided by Brewery Ommegang, in the Cobleskill lab's walk-in fridge. Plant biotech research is the sort of work normally undertaken by a well-funded graduate lab at a large university. But there is no grad program at Cobleskill, a small college of 2,500 students within the SUNY network.  Farmers and brewers alike could benefit from research. In eight years, the number of acres in New York devoted to hops has grown from 15 to more than 400, according to Steve Miller of Cornell University's Cooperative Extension. He's the state's first ""hop specialist""; he's been offering assistance to hops growers and also surveying them for the past several years. Miller says that New York brewers with the Farm Brewery License produce about 50,000 barrels of beer a year. In order to make enough profit from their crops, area farmers sell hops in-state within the larger umbrella of craft brewers (producing over 1 million barrels a year), as well as to brewers in other states and Europe, in order to compete with large-scale growers in the Pacific Northwest. Control for disease, in particular downy mildew, is critical. Jason Stone is the hops master at Brewery Ommegang in Cooperstown. Stone oversees the company's trial hopyard, determining which species grow well in the climate and soil, and develop unique flavors specific to the region — enough that brewers both in- and out-of-state will want to purchase them. ""It can take over,"" he says of downy mildew. ""That gives you either a low yield, or a lower quality hop. It wouldn't be worth a brewer's time to buy that crop."" But if Cobleskill students can make locally grown plants more mildew-resistant, he says, ""we'll have globally competitive hops."" To help them along, Stone supplied some of the plants the students are using in the lab. Once the hop calluses are ready, likely during the Winter semester, students will infect them with agrobacteria that will transfer DNA that contains a fungus-resistant gene. If all goes well, the students will analyze the modified plants this Spring to make sure the right genetic traits have been transferred, sow them in Cobleskill's on-site hopyard, and grow them out. McMaster-Schuyler is optimistic about their prospects for success, although uncertain how long the process will ultimately take. Cobleskill's biotech students ""have already done this [in an earlier project] with drought- and disease-resistant switchgrass, and perfected certain techniques,"" she says. After the growing-out phase, the current researchers will all have graduated. On their heels, a new batch of undergrads will test the engineered plants for disease resistance, presenting their findings as they go at biotech conferences. If the project is successful, eventually they, or their successors, will publish research in a scientific journal. This is hardly a quick road to mildew obstruction. But Ommegang's Stone points out that building the state's hop industry back up is a project for the long haul. ""It's similar to when vineyards were getting started in New York,"" he says, referencing another agricultural success story for the state. ""That took about 30 years in all.""

npr,"October 23, 2017",The FDA Will Decide Whether 26 Ingredients Count As Fiber," What counts as dietary fiber? That's up for debate. The Food and Drug Administration is reviewing 26 ingredients that food manufacturers use to bulk up the fiber content of processed foods to determine if there's a health benefit. If you're a nutrition-label reader, the list includes some familiar-ish sounding ingredients — such as inulin, which is often sourced from chicory root. Other ingredients on the ""do-these-count-as-fiber?"" list include gum acacia, bamboo fiber, retrograded corn starch, and — get ready for a tongue-twister — xylooligosaccharides. Some of these fibers are extracted from plant sources, while others are synthetic. Some critics argue that the FDA should not allow these added fibers to count as fiber on nutrition facts labels. ""The food industry has hijacked the advice to eat more fiber by putting isolated, highly processed fiber into what are essentially junk foods,"" says Bonnie Liebman of the consumer group Center for Science in the Public Interest. A bunch of packaged foods contain added fiber. Some examples include Fiber One bar products, some cereal and instant oatmeal products, as well as some pastas and English muffins. Liebman says most people know that an apple is a healthier choice than a high-fiber brownie, but when they see high fiber counts on the label, ""it may just be enough to convince them to go with the brownie.""

 Liebman argues a much better way to get the recommended 25 to 38 grams of daily fiber is to eat more foods that are naturally rich in fiber such as fruits, vegetables, beans and whole grains. High-fiber diets may help protect against a range of diseases, from Type 2 diabetes and heart disease to certain types of cancer. The FDA lists a range of health benefits linked to dietary fiber. For instance, fiber can help lower blood glucose and cholesterol levels, as well as blood pressure. Fiber can also aid laxation and bowel function, and it can promote a feeling of fullness, which may lead people to eat less. The FDA is in the process of determining whether isolated and synthetic fibers provide a beneficial physiological effect to human health. The agency says that going forward, there must be at least one demonstrated benefit. ""Only fibers that meet the definition can be declared as a dietary fiber on the Nutrition Facts label,"" according to this Q&amp;A; about the review process. The agency is reviewing the science. The food industry has weighed in, pointing to the demonstrated benefits of some of these added fibers. ""I think the main benefit is that they contribute to regularity and laxation,"" says Robert Burns, vice president of health and nutrition policy at the Grocery Manufacturers Association. Burns says most people don't consume enough fiber, so ""if you can supplement [with] snack bars that people are eating, it [can] go a long way to meeting dietary recommendations."" Critics say an optimal diet is one that includes lots of whole foods such as fruits, vegetables, nuts, beans and whole grains. These foods are not only naturally rich in fiber, they also contain other beneficial compounds such as vitamins, minerals and anti-inflammatory compounds. ""Highly processed snack bars typically contain combinations of processed starch and added sugar. They're low in vitamins and minerals,"" says Dr. David Ludwig of the Harvard School of Public Health. ""Just adding isolated fiber back in [to these processed foods] does not cover up for those nutritional deficiencies.""

UNIDENTIFIED SINGERS: (Singing) You don't say ham. You say Spam. Spam is real spiced ham. Spam is real spiced ham. SINGH: In Hawaii, a recent spate of Spam thefts has put authorities on alert. TINA YAMAKI: Spam has always been one of those things that people have stolen in the past, but we've seen a rash increase recently within the last few months, where people are now stealing multiple cases of Spam. SINGH: Tina Yamaki is president of the retail merchants of Hawaii. She says that many of the retailers she works with around Honolulu have reported an increase in Spam heists, with teams of people involved, a phenomenon she calls organized retail crime. YAMAKI: When you start to steal 11 to 18 cases of Spam, it's more than just feeding your family. SINGH: Yamaki is quick to point out that it isn't just Spam that's being stolen. Retailers are also reporting more thefts of other easily stash high-value goods like corned beef and liquor. Yamaki chalks that up to a recent change in criminal law penalties which upped the threshold to be charged with a felony by about $400. YAMAKI: Well, it is a black market of some sort. We've heard that, you know, it's being resold in homeless camps, out of back of trucks at the swap meet, to people in and around their neighborhoods. I mean, there's a whole lot of rumors of where these things are being sold. SINGH: The problem's gotten bad enough for some grocery and convenience stores around the island to start keeping some popular canned goods under lock and key. Lani Sumait is a supervisor at Tamura's Market in Hau'ula, Hawaii. Sumait says that they're keeping Spam close to the front register and locking up corned beef. And while she understands that mainlanders may find Spam sort of funny, she says, to her, it is not a laughing matter. LANI SUMAIT: You're stealing from my pocket because my employer can't give me a raise because he has to cover the cost of all the loss. So yeah, I take it personal, I do. SINGH: As for the semi-organized criminals behind the Spam spree. Lani Sumait says she'll be leaving that problem to the professionals at the Honolulu Police Department. Copyright © 2017 NPR.

npr,"October 22, 2017",Blending Techno And Tradition: You Should Be Dancing ... With Sake," If techno makes you think of pulsating music and mood-altering illegal drugs in sweaty nightclubs, and if sake conjures up notions of scalding hot liquor in tiny cups that are impossible to hold, then international DJ and electronic music artist Richie Hawtin would like to change those perceptions. It's not that either is incorrect, it's just that he believes electronic music and sake have far more in common than you might think — and may even enhance the experience of one another. ""I first traveled to Japan in 1994 and, upon landing, the culture immediately made a deep impression on me,"" says Hawtin. ""I found a country filled with beautiful contrasts which balanced high technology and deep cultural traditions."" It's a correlation — that marriage of past and present — that would be naturally intriguing to the British-born Hawtin, who recorded for many years under the name Plastikman and is considered a pioneer of minimalist electronic music characterized by alternating quantities of moodiness, melody and monotony, and combining classical concepts with modern technology. Growing up primarily in Windsor, Ontario, Hawtin learned about electronica from his dad, a fan of German techno bands like Tangerine Dream and Kraftwerk, then cut his teeth across the river as a DJ in the Detroit club scene in the late 1980s, mixing techno and house music. Hawtin continued to hone his craft in clubs and studios around the world, but it was that early visit to Japan that inspired him to take a deep dive into sake. Initially, the locals laughed at him when he ordered the rice wine, calling it an ""old man's drink"" as they ordered beer. Soon enough, however, they became interested in teaching Hawtin about sake's subtleties. ""I started to learn more of the old customs of pouring for one another,"" he recalls, ""and with each bottle, I realized how beautifully social sake was in these communal types of experiences."" Sake is made by a process of brewing rice that has been polished; all rice is brown, but removing 40 percent or more of the husk, bran and germ yields the white interior. The ratios of polishing can allow the brewer to achieve different flavor profiles, from dry to acidic to floral. According to sake expert John Gautner, milling (or polishing) the rice helps to remove unwanted fat, protein and amino acids before fermentation: ""This leads to cleaner, more elegant and more refined sake. It also allows more lively aromatics to come about."" To some, sake might seem somewhat like a beer-wine hybrid: the rice is brewed with yeast, like a beer, but is not carbonated. And like wine, it is aged to allow the flavors to develop. While making sake is a centuries-old craft, new techniques and inventions — like modern rice polishing equipment that can accurately remove certain percentages of a single grain of rice — have allowed for a renaissance in high-quality sake. Hawtin started to get serious about sake in 2008, when he took a class with Gautner, visiting Japanese breweries to learn about production and participating in extensive tastings of sake's six different categories: Junmai, Honjozo, Junmai Ginjo, Ginjo, Junmai Daiginjo and Daiginjo. Since then, Hawtin says, ""I just followed my own taste and let it take me on countless adventures."" As his knowledge expanded, Hawtin began to think about how sake connects to music. ""Enjoying sake at dinner before a long night out or before one of my sets, I found that sake had the perfect balance of alcohol with little to no additives — which gives a completely different experience and feeling from other drinks,"" he says. Later, taking his obsession to a new level, Hawtin opened a sake bar in Ibiza, Spain, a hotspot for electronic music and international clubbers more associated with copious amounts of vodka than fermented rice beverages. After that sake bar closed in 2015, he launched the Enter.Sake project, in which Hawtin works with traditional brewers to create a signature line of sake, with a goal to help bring more premium sakes into the Western consciousness. ""So many people have had bad experiences with sake,"" Hawtin says. ""Older, lower-grade sake that found its way out of Japan was presented to us as warmed-up, hot alcohol — which I like to refer to as rocket fuel."" Hawtin's project focuses on craft sakes, some of which are produced at breweries that date back to the 18th century. But how does sake relate to electronic music? For Hawtin, it's the interplay between layers of flavors and music, and how small adjustments — polishing small percentages of a grain of rice or zeroing in on a single beat — can affect the balance of the result. ""I firmly believe that sake resonates at its own unique frequency in a similar way to the electronic music I produce and play,"" he says. ""Combining these two ingredients is a recipe for a beautifully hypnotic experience."" Ben Klock, ""Twenty"" with Junmai Daiginjo: Subtle hypnotic repetition in the music complements this top-of-the-line style of sake requiring that at least 50 percent of rice grains are milled, resulting in a sake that is typically soft, fruity and fragrant. Dubfire, ""Ribcage (Adrian Sherwood remix)"" with Junmai Nama Genshu: A mind-altering buildup that pairs with this sake's earthy, bold flavors and higher alcohol content. Charlotte de Witte, ""Control (Original Mix)"" with Honjozo: Focused intensity that brings out the inherent fragrance found in this drier sake. Honjozo is characterized by the small amount of distilled ethyl alcohol, or ""brewer's alcohol,"" which is added during the final stages of production. Etapp Kyle, ""Essay"" with Junmai Ginjo: Melodic intervention sets the tone for this track, making its rhythmic precision play well with the full-bodied Junmai Ginjo, a crowd-pleasing sake.

npr,"October 20, 2017","Anthony Bourdain On 'Appetites,' Washing Dishes And The Food He Still Won't Eat"," This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies, in for Terry Gross. Our guest, Anthony Bourdain, takes TV audiences to places all over the world, exploring local cultures and cuisine and offering his own unique commentary on what we see. His series, ""Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,"" is now in its 10th season on CNN. Bourdain also has a documentary called ""Wasted"" about how much food we waste and what we can do about it. Before he discovered his gift for writing and storytelling, Bourdain spent decades in the restaurant business becoming the chef in what he describes as a working-class brasserie in New York. Then he wrote a best-selling book, ""Kitchen Confidential,"" and several others, and began producing and starring in TV shows about food in the places he loves and visits. He has a habit of saying exactly what he thinks, which has led to some public battles with others in the food world over the years. I spoke to Anthony Bourdain last fall, when he published a new cookbook called ""Appetites."" Well, Anthony Bourdain, welcome to FRESH AIR. I'd like to begin with a reading from the book. Share this with us. ANTHONY BOURDAIN: (Reading) What is it that normal people do? What makes a normal happy family? How do they behave? What do they eat at home? How do they live their lives? I had little clue how to answer these questions for most of my working life as I'd been living it on the margins. I didn't know any normal people. From age 17 on, normal people had been my customers. They were abstractions, literally shadowy silhouettes in the dining room of wherever it was I was working at the time. I looked at them through the perspective of the lifelong professional cook and chef, which is to say as someone who did not have a family life, who knew and associated only with fellow restaurant professionals, who worked while normal people played and who played while normal people slept. (Reading) To the extent that I knew or understood normal people's behaviors, it was to anticipate their immediate desires. Would they be ordering the chicken or the salmon? I usually saw them only at their worst - hungry, drunk, horny, ill-tempered, celebrating good fortune or taking out the bad on their servers. What they did at home, what it might be like to wake up late on a Sunday morning, make pancakes for a child, watch cartoons, throw a ball around a backyard, these were things I only knew from movies. DAVIES: Thanks. And that's one of the reasons you wrote a cookbook about normal food and normal everyday stuff. BOURDAIN: Indeed, yeah. DAVIES: You seem like you had a normal life. You grew up in Fort Lee, N.J. Your parents sounded like normal people. Why didn't you get along with normal people? BOURDAIN: I don't know. I was an angry kid. You know, as a child of the Kennedy years, the Summer of Love I missed, I wasn't old enough for everything that was happening with the subculture. So when I became an adolescent, I was disappointed, very disappointed, bitterly disappointed with the way the country was going. I seemed to have missed the good times. For whatever reason, I was definitely a very angry, bitter, nihilistic, destructive and self-destructive kid. DAVIES: You did acid when you were 13. Is this true? BOURDAIN: Yeah. Like most 13-year-olds, I think - 13-year-old boys in particular - you know, I was awkward. I lacked confidence. I was looking for some kind of a template for a personality. And I guess like a lot of people of the time, I found that in drugs. I defined myself by the drugs I was taking, and I identified with the people who did similar drugs. And the people who were doing LSD and marijuana and other drugs, those were the people I wanted to hang out with. DAVIES: You found a home in - among restaurant people, right? You dropped out of college, went to culinary school. BOURDAIN: Yeah. Well, I started working as a dishwasher one summer. And it was really a big event for me because up to that point, I was lazy. This was the first discipline, the first organization because it is a very militaristic organization, the kitchen brigade, the first people whose respect I wanted and the first time in my life that - that I went home feeling respect for myself. I mean, I'd work - it was very hard work. You had to be there on time. There were certain absolute rules. And for whatever reason, I responded to that. It was a mix of chaos but also considerable order that I guess I needed at the time. DAVIES: It's interesting that you describe the discipline because a lot of what people think of when they think of restaurant people is a really wild, hedonistic lifestyle, the hour - after-hour stuff that goes on forever. BOURDAIN: At its root, it is factory work in the sense that the religion of any successful or busy restaurant is consistency. You have to do the same dish the same way and on time. I was a happy dishwasher. I jokingly say that I learned every important lesson, all the most important lessons of my life as a dishwasher. And in some ways, that's true, but it is a very organized thing. I mean, no one lasts in the restaurant business who does not present they're part of an order, which requires many people, on time. You - it's a - it's not a team sport, but it's a team activity. And if you let the team down, everybody crashes. DAVIES: Your big breakthrough came with the book ""Kitchen Confidential,"" huge best-seller, started with an article you wrote. Tell us that story. BOURDAIN: Well, I wrote a piece intending it for a free paper called the New York Press that they give out of little boxes on the corner. You know, they offered me $100. You know, I figured their standards were low enough that they would take it. And my intention was to entertain a few other people in the restaurant business in the New York area. I thought that would be really cool. I was a fan of George Orwell's ""Down And Out In Paris And London."" And that account of another dishwasher's life had thrilled me. And I kind of wanted to evoke that response in a few other cooks. DAVIES: And for people who don't know... BOURDAIN: Yeah. DAVIES: ...What's the kind of the substance of the story you were writing about? BOURDAIN: I just wanted to write about my life from the point of view of a working journeyman chef of no particular distinction, honestly. Maybe - I didn't mind goosing the general public, horrifying them a little, but that was not the intention. I wanted to just write about our thing, our life the way we spoke in the same sort of over-testosteroned (ph) high-speed hyperbolic prose that I was familiar with in the kitchens. But the customer, the intended reader, was always a fellow professional who would get it, and I hoped they would get it and respond. So I wrote the piece. They said they'd take it. And they kept bumping it. Every week, I'd run to the box on the corner and open the magazine - open the paper and I wasn't in that issue. And eventually, at a moment of frustration, I think my mom said to me, well, you should send it to The New Yorker. You know, I know someone there. They'll read it. And I thought, OK, great, you know, of course, The New Yorker, the possibility of - the likelihood of ever being published for an over the transom piece there is astronomical. DAVIES: Doesn't happen, yeah. BOURDAIN: So I sent it along. And to my surprise, a few weeks later, phone rings in the kitchen. It's David Remnick on the phone. They ran the piece. And, I mean - I had a book contract - a book deal within days. And when the book came out, it very quickly transformed my life - I mean, changed everything. DAVIES: Now, the book and the article is this like grab-your-attention look at things you don't know about what goes on inside the restaurant and all kinds of things. But, I mean, it's - the writing is powerful. Had you been writing while you were cooking - creative workshops, creative writing classes, no? BOURDAIN: No, I had done a writer's workshop with Gordon Lish, the notorious creative writing teacher at one point many years earlier. But I'd never actually written. And I think to a great extent, the reason ""Kitchen Confidential"" sounds like it does is I just did not have the luxury or the burden of a lot of time to sit around and contemplate the mysteries of the universe. I had to wake up at 5 o'clock in the morning, write for an hour and a half, and then I had to go to work to a real job. So I - here I was. It was liberating in the sense that I had no time to think about what I was writing. And I certainly had no customer or reader in mind because I was quite sure no one would ever read it. That was, in many ways, a very liberating place to be. And I've kind of tried to stick with that business model since. DAVIES: Anthony Bourdain's series ""Parts Unknown"" is now in its 10th season on CNN. We'll talk more after a break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF DEEP BLUE ORGAN TRIO'S ""TELL ME SOMETHING GOOD"") DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. We're listening to my interview recorded last year with Anthony Bourdain. His CNN series, ""Parts Unknown,"" is now in its 10th season. And he has a new documentary about food waste called ""Wasted."" Well, you're now on your third television show. You did a show called ""No Reservations"" for the Food Channel, right? BOURDAIN: Yeah. DAVIES: And then ""The Layover,"" 48 hours in... BOURDAIN: And actually, before that, there was ""A Cook's Tour,"" so... DAVIES: OK. Right, right. BOURDAIN: Third network, fourth show. DAVIES: Right. And now you're traveling around the world visiting places in ""Parts Unknown."" And I thought we'd begin with a clip. This is the beginning of your trip to Borneo on this series. Let's just listen how it starts. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""ANTHONY BOURDAIN: PARTS UNKNOWN"") BOURDAIN: When I first went up this river, I was sick with love, the bad kind, the fist-around-your-heart kind. I ran far, but there was no escaping it. It followed me up river all the way. That was 10 long years ago, a previous episode of a previous series in a previous life. Yet, here I am again heading up to that same long house in the jungle. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) DAVIES: And that's from your series ""Parts Unknown."" You know, these are part travelogue, part personal essay and a lot about food. This seemed really personal. What did you want - why did you want to go back to this little village in Borneo after 10 years? BOURDAIN: I kind of - I think I wanted to see how things had changed. Someone said - some travel writer said that, you know, you - what you're really looking at when you travel is inward all the time. The first time I went up that river, the Skrang River from Kuching up to a Iban longhouse in the jungle, I was heartbreaken (ph). I was coming off of a love affair that did not pan out the way I had hoped. I think in a lot of ways, the motivation for the show - the second one - was to see if it still hurt, you know, to see how I felt. So it was very personal. I thought I was going to go right back to the same longhouse. Yes, let's see how that community has changed. But really, it was revisiting an old wound to see if it was OK now. DAVIES: There's a moment in this powerful scene in there - I mean, in this episode where you're standing in pouring rain with a spear in your hand. You've been granted an honor by the village. Explain this. BOURDAIN: Well, I think both times when I went to the - both times when I went to the village as the guest of honor, you know, they kill a pig for the feast. The whole village eats. There's an equitable division of pig parts. It's a big deal. But that first time, I don't think I'd ever killed an animal before. I mean, I'd been ordering them up as a chef over the phone, so I was culpable in the death of many animals. But here I was being asked to physically plunge a spear into the heart of a pig. It seemed to me the height of hypocrisy, however uncomfortable I might have been with that, to put it off on somebody else. You know, I'd been responsible for the death of many animals. Here I'm being asked - I didn't want to let the team down. I didn't want to dishonor the village or embarrass anyone. The first time was very, very, very, very difficult. My camera guys almost passed out. It was certainly very difficult for me. The second time, as much as I'd like to say that it was still really hard - and I think I said in the voiceover I don't know what it says about me, probably something very bad, that I'd become - you know, I have changed over time, I like to think in good ways for the most part. But I've also become more callous. I've become able to plunge a spear into the heart of a screaming pig and live with that much more comfortably than I did the first time. And I can lie and say it tormented me forever and since, but, you know, I felt that ugly emotion or lack of it, and I thought I should mention it. DAVIES: Yeah. You said, I did it this time without hesitation or remorse. BOURDAIN: Yeah. DAVIES: But it was a relief when the screaming stopped. BOURDAIN: Well, yes, no one - no good person likes to hear or see an animal in pain. That is monstrous. I mean, I tried very hard to do a good job quickly. Yeah, exactly right. DAVIES: You had a memorable episode recently where you went to Vietnam. And you - I can't remember whether you said this in an episode or whether I read it somewhere else - you said the world tilted for you in a Vietnamese rice farmer's home. BOURDAIN: Yeah. I think the first time I went to Vietnam, I just - I remember coming away from it thinking, I just - I have to have more of this. This is what I want to do with the rest of my life... DAVIES: More of Vietnam or more of that kind of travel? BOURDAIN: I want to be able to come back to Vietnam again and again and again. And if this place is so wonderful, the world must be filled with many more wonderful and interesting and challenging and heartbreaking and inspiring and beautiful places, as it turned out to. But I really got - the first time I went there, I think I found myself sitting in a - yeah, it was a rice farmer's home in the Mekong Delta. At the time, they were a little more suspicious of Westerners with cameras, so the people who I was allowed to eat dinner with were all former Viet Cong with impeccable revolutionary credentials, the sort of people who you would think would be hostile to Americans, particularly in that area where they caught a lot of ugly action. I got just hammered drunk and had this sort of wonderful bonding experience. I remember this, like, 85-year-old former Viet Cong, I asked him, aren't you angry about anything? And he looked and with amiable contempt, said, look, buddy, Vietnam, don't take yourself so seriously. Before you, there were, you know, the French, the Japanese, you know, the Chinese, the Cambodians. Since you there's been - you know, I've been fighting - this country's been fighting for 600 years. Don't take it personally, now drink. DAVIES: You go to some far-flung exotic places and some places that are a lot closer to home. And I wanted to play a clip. This is from your visit to a place in Camden, N.J. BOURDAIN: Yes. DAVIES: Donkey's, that makes cheesesteaks. It's right across the river from Philadelphia... BOURDAIN: Yes. DAVIES: ...Known for cheesesteaks. And you're sitting down to enjoy one with the owner. Let's listen. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""ANTHONY BOURDAIN: PARTS UNKNOWN"") ROBERT LUCAS: Pleasure to meet you. BOURDAIN: So this is the place - the best cheesesteak in South Jersey, unless I'm mistaken. LUCAS: In New Jersey. BOURDAIN: In New Jersey, period? LUCAS: Yeah. BOURDAIN: Is there a difference between Jersey style and Philadelphia style? LUCAS: Yeah, we do ours on a round poppy seed Kaiser roll. BOURDAIN: Really? I'll have one of those. What's the way to go? I mean, anything I need to know or just... LUCAS: No, a regular - cheese and onions. BOURDAIN: A beautiful thing. LUCAS: I need one, Paulie (ph). BOURDAIN: It's round. It's got steak, spices, browned onions, real American cheese - such as it is - and a poppy seed roll. Fantastic. Thank you, sir. And it is sublime. Relish? What do you think? LUCAS: That's hot pepper. Yeah, a little bit of that won't hurt. BOURDAIN: A little bit? Oh man, I drove a long way for this. I've been thinking about it the whole way. LUCAS: Good. BOURDAIN: Man, this should be, like, a national landmark right away. This sandwich is unbelievably good. LUCAS: Thanks. BOURDAIN: Really a thing of beauty. LUCAS: That's good to hear. BOURDAIN: Worth driving across the state in a blizzard for. LUCAS: Well, we get a lot of people from Philly. BOURDAIN: No way, Philly? LUCAS: Oh, yes, for sure. BOURDAIN: Wow, that's treason. Do they, like, change the plates on their car and, like, wear a disguise? I mean... LUCAS: It's different. The poppy seeds help. BOURDAIN: Yeah, and I like this roll. It's awesome. That's delicious. Well, I think we've learned something here today. Jersey cheesesteaks - I'm not saying they're better than Philadelphia - yeah, I am, actually, so there. This is great. LUCAS: Glad you enjoyed it. DAVIES: That's fun. That joint's about five miles from here. I'm going to get over there. BOURDAIN: Yeah, it's good stuff. DAVIES: I'm going to get over there. Do you care about the reactions you get from the locals after the episodes appear? BOURDAIN: I care about the - yes. I - what I want to happen ideally - and it's so weird. It's a double-edged sword. Ideally, I'll go to a place like - I'll find a little bar in Rio, let's say, some little local place that perfectly expresses the neighborhood. You know, it's not on the - it's not a tourist-friendly place. The response I'm looking for is to hear from someone from the neighborhood saying, how did you ever find that place? I thought only we knew about it. It's, you know, a - truly a place that we love and is reflective of our culture and our neighborhood. But on the other hand, that's kind of a destructive process because if I name the place - and I don't always when it's a place like that - I've changed it. The next time I go back, there's tourists. There's people who've seen it on the show. And then I might hear from the same person from that neighborhood say, you ruined my favorite bar, (laughter) you know? All the regular customers have run away and it's filled with, you know, tourists in ugly T-shirts and flip-flops. DAVIES: Do you sometimes protect somebody's identity? BOURDAIN: There are times that I have looked at the camera and said, look, I'm just not going to tell you where this place is. I don't want to change it. It should stay like this forever. I do do that now and again. DAVIES: You're known for being willing to eat just about anything. What's some of the most intimidating or nasty stuff you've been offered? BOURDAIN: I don't know. I mean, at this point, if freshness and hygiene is a question - I mean, generally it's tribal situations that are problematic where the whole tribe - the chief is offering you something, that's what they have. And often they don't have refrigeration. It's often old. Their tolerance for meat that's even spoiled is higher than my relatively sensitive stomach. Often, these dishes are eaten in one large bowl with the whole tribe jamming their fingers in. So yeah, rotten food, food that's clearly not clean, water that's clearly not good - those are a challenge. On the flavor spectrum, I'm pretty good with just about everything. There are a few dishes that are - you know, when you get to, like, rotten shark in Iceland, that's - I mean, I could do it, but I'd rather not be doing that again. DAVIES: You did it? BOURDAIN: Yeah. Yeah. It's unpleasant, but, I mean, it's not the end of the world. I don't know, for sheer, soul-destroying misery, like the - you know, if you're talking about a bite of food that just makes me question the future of the human race and just sends me into a spiral of depression, I think eating at an airport Johnny Rockets pretty much would be the nadir. DAVIES: (Laughter) That's as bad as it gets. In a circumstance that you just described, where there's food that's rotten or not clean, how do you handle it? BOURDAIN: You take one for the team and you hope for the best and hope that you have a good supply of antibiotics. I've lost three days of work in 16 years. Three or - I think only three days that I've been, you know, down for the count and confined to bed and desperately, horribly ill. Generally speaking, if it's, like, a street food stall that's busy, even if it looks dirty as hell, if there are a lot of locals there, they're eating and they're happy, my crew will always eat at that place. You know, eating a Caesar salad at the major chain hotel in, you know, Central Africa or the Middle East, these are - that's where you run into trouble stomach-wise, generally. DAVIES: Anthony Bourdain's CNN series ""Parts Unknown"" is now in its 10th season. And he has a new documentary about food waste called ""Wasted."" We'll hear more of our conversation after a short break. Also, Ken Tucker reviews the new album by singer-songwriter Nora Jane Struthers, and Justin Chang reviews the new horror film ""The Killing Of A Sacred Deer."" I'm David Davies, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF URI CAINE'S ""TEU CHAMEGO"") DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies, in for Terry Gross. We're speaking with food writer and TV host Anthony Bourdain. His series, ""Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,"" is now in its 10th season on CNN. And he has a new documentary about food waste called ""Wasted."" When we left off, he was describing unusual food he's had to eat in his travels, some of it rotten. You must have a heck of a microbiome... BOURDAIN: I would think so. I think everyone on our show, all of our veteran crew, are pretty good about that. We have pretty good resistance. We don't get sick easily. And when somebody new joins the team, you know, we tell them the rules of the road. But if after we've told them general do's and don'ts, if we find ourselves sitting at a - as happened in, I think, Kurdistan, in Iraq, and where some new member of the team says, oh, look, Zuppa di Vongole, like, seafood - you know, like, a seafood stew. And we're awful far from the ocean right now. And we all looked at each other and we're like, should we tell him? Should we say something? And we all just said, nah, let him learn. DAVIES: (Laughter) Is it true in Namibia you were offered an unwashed warthog rectum? BOURDAIN: Yeah. Well, they killed a pig, and apparently that was the - you know, the chief yanks that part out and throws it on the grill and grills it medium rare and splits it with me. And I look - the whole tribe is watching. He's offering me what he sees as the best part. That's a clear take-one-for-the-team situation. What am I going to do, refuse him, embarrass him in front of his people, look ungrateful? That changes the whole tenor of the relationship. I mean, when somebody's offering you food, they're telling you a story. They're telling you what they like, who they are. Presumably, it's a proud reflection of their culture, their history, often a very tough history. You turn your nose up at that important moment, the whole relationship changes, and it will never be the same. DAVIES: What did it taste like? BOURDAIN: It tasted like exactly what you would expect - a sandy, gritty rectum. DAVIES: (Laughter) OK. We're speaking with Anthony Bourdain. He has a new cookbook called ""Appetites."" This is an interesting cookbook to look at and to read. You write in it there's nothing remotely innovative in the recipes. You're lifting them from imperfect memories of childhood favorites. Why this kind of book? BOURDAIN: Well, I wanted it to be useful, approachable, reflective of the life I've lived over the past eight or nine years as a father, as opposed to a professional trying to dazzle with, you know, pretty pictures and food that's different than everybody else's. No, I wanted to make a beautiful cookbook, creative-looking one spoken in honest, straightforward, casual terms that gives the reader reasonable expectations, that encourages them to organize themselves in the way that I've found to be useful as a professional. But as far as the recipes, you know, when I cook at home, it's with a 9-year-old girl in mind. I mean, she's who I need to please. And if she's not happy, I'm not happy. The whole house revolves around her and her friends, so it's reflective of that. It's also reflective of, I think, age and all those years in the restaurant business. Most chefs I know after work do not want to go out to dinner and be forced to think about what they're eating in a critical or analytical way. They want to experience food as they did as children, in an emotional way, the pure pleasure of that bowl of spicy noodles or even a - you know, a bowl of soup that their mom gave them on a rainy day when they'd been bullied in school. I mean, that's a happy time when you can escape this world, you know, and lose yourself in food. So these are recipes that hopefully - where I try to evoke those kinds of feelings and emotions. DAVIES: You reluctantly address the subject of breakfast. You said... BOURDAIN: Yeah. DAVIES: ...As a professional, the smell of breakfast was the smell of defeat... BOURDAIN: Well... DAVIES: ...Because... BOURDAIN: ...You know, I do not have a particularly prestigious or notable career. And for much of the time as a chef, I was unemployable by respectable businesses. And the only people who would hire me would hire me for brunch shifts because most cooks hated doing brunch for very good reasons. I was good at it, but it was the only work I could get. And I came to hate the - you know, when you're cooking 300 omelets a day and, you know, scraping waffles out of the waffle iron and making French toast and pancakes and, you know, cooking hundreds of pounds of home fries, those smells, those associations, those were very painful times - you know, addiction, post-addiction. You know, I was a desperate man, often working under a pseudonym when I was cooking brunch. So I really hated it. And I also hated the whole concept of brunch. And later as a chef, I hated it because it was a huge profit center that caused problems for me as an employer because all my cooks hated to do it. But it was such a moneymaker because people are so foolishly happy to pay $22 for the same two eggs and bacon, you know, that they have during the week for $7 or even - or $3. You know, give them a free mimosa and a little strawberry fan and suddenly they're happy to - I just had utter contempt for the entire enterprise. But now that I'm the father of a little girl... DAVIES: You're happily throwing pancake parties for her and her friends. BOURDAIN: Well, that makes me happy, seeing the look of delight in my daughter's eyes and her friends when her daddy offers an entire pancake bar with options for blueberry, chocolate chip, teddy bear or regular pancakes. I'm feeling pretty good about myself with those customers. DAVIES: All right, so back to the cookbook. You tell us about breakfast. One of the things I was shocked to read is you don't fry bacon. You cook it in the oven? BOURDAIN: Yeah. I think it's a - first of all, it's nicer. I mean, you know, you stink up the whole - I live in an apartment in New York, so frying bacon, first of all, is going to stink up the whole apartment. Second of all, it's really - particularly if you're naked, never fry bacon while naked. DAVIES: (Laughter). BOURDAIN: It's a very dangerous business. And it's just not the best way to evenly cook bacon. We all like - most of us like crispy bacon or at least evenly cooked. And the best way to do it in my experience and the way we always did it in restaurants was to lay it out on a baking parchment and put in the oven and cook patiently but evenly, turning occasionally because there are hotspots in ovens. You get a much better product. DAVIES: Do you often cook naked? BOURDAIN: Well, now that I have a 9-year-old around, no. But prior to that experience, I did have some bacon-related nudity-related injuries that were memorable, let's put it that way. DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, we're speaking with Anthony Bourdain. His CNN series ""Parts Unknown"" explores cultures and cuisine around the world. Some of the episodes, a lot of them are about food, some about travel, some about, you know, your personal feelings. And sometimes - I mean, like the episode in the Congo, a lot of that is about just the history of that nation and it being brutalized by Westerners and their... BOURDAIN: That was - there was no expectation that - it would be obscene to go to the Congo looking to do a food show. We do many food-centric shows. We do comic shows. But some shows are agenda-driven. And I had an agenda here, and that was to, for an hour of television, talk about the history of this tragic - incredibly tragic-afflicted history that most people are unaware of. This wealthy in natural resources - this massive country, such a - I was sort of obsessed with this - the tragically-little-known history of this very complicated country. And I wanted to talk about it. I also have long - it's a repeating theme on this show, both ""Apocalypse Now"" and Conrad's ""Heart Of Darkness,"" so that was an irresistible impulse to go up the Congo River. DAVIES: As you've traveled around the world so much and you love street food - but you've - so you've seen kind of cheap authentically-made food and you've seen a lot of poverty and what - how people get by. Has that made you less interested in high-end dining? BOURDAIN: Yeah. I think - because on one hand, I'm happiest in experiencing food in the most purely emotional way. And it's true of most of my chef friends as well when it's, like, street food or a one-chef-one-dish operation where they're just somebody who's really, really good at one or two or three things that they've been doing for a very long time that's maybe reflective of their ethnicity or their culture or their nationality. Those are the things that just make me happy. And I'm - you know, I'm spoiled like a lot of fellow chefs. We get a lot of fine wines and dinners thrown our way. And you do reach this enviable point where you just don't want to sit there for four hours with course after course after course. It's too much, first of all. It doesn't feel good at the end of all that time. And it's not interesting. And you don't want to - you know, if it's - if the waiter's taking 10 minutes to describe each dish, you know, it only took you three to eat it - something's really wrong. I mean, I think people lose sight of the fact that chefs should be ultimately in the pleasure business, not in the look-at-me business. DAVIES: You sometimes visit places where there are really contentious political issues. BOURDAIN: Yes. DAVIES: You say you're not a journalist. You're a storyteller. But you must think carefully about how you deal with that stuff? BOURDAIN: Well, there's nothing actually more political than food - I mean, who's eating, who's not eating? Also it's - I found it's just very, very useful to not be a journalist. I mean, journalists drop into a situation, ask a question. People sort of tighten up. Whereas if you sit down with people and just say, hey, what makes you happy? What's your life like? What do you like to eat? More often than not, they will tell you extraordinary things, many of which have nothing to do with food. So yeah, we've shot in some pretty contentious places. We shot in Beirut during the war and since, Congo, Gaza, post-Benghazi Libya. I'm not a journalist, but I think it is useful as a - as an addition to journalism to have seen what people are like in Libya, for instance. I mean, who are these people we are talking about when we talk about Benghazi or Libya? Is it not useful to see them with their kids, to see how their lives, their everyday lives are doing - seemingly ordinary things or trying to do ordinary things, to show what people actually live like in Iran who may not support their government at all? What are ordinary people like in Iran? We seem all too eager and willing to ignore those things. I think in southern or, you know, sub-Saharan Africa, in particular, we are - seem to be so used to seeing people of color in these disastrous situations that we become inured and callous. So it's always useful to, especially in Africa, say, look, you know, there are lives happening here. This is what's involved in getting water for the table. You know, this is how nice people can be or how gentle or complicated. It just seems to me the more you are able to show people's everyday lives often as they revolve around food and daily tasks, when something happens in the news, you have a better idea who we're talking about here. DAVIES: Anthony Bourdain, thanks so much. It's been fun. BOURDAIN: Thank you. DAVIES: Anthony Bourdain's series ""Parts Unknown"" is now in its 10th season on CNN. And he has a new documentary about food waste called ""Wasted."" Coming up, Ken Tucker reviews the new album from singer-songwriter Nora Jane Struthers. This is FRESH AIR. Copyright © 2017 NPR.

npr,"October 26, 2017",George H.W. Bush Responds To Groping Allegations," Former President George H.W. Bush has acknowledged touching multiple women inappropriately in what his spokesman called ""patt[ing] women's rears in what he intended to be a good-natured manner."" Two women have reportedly accused the former president of groping them while posing for photographs with Bush in recent years. Actress Heather Lind wrote a post on Instagram, which has since been deleted, about an incident from early 2014. ""[W]hen I got the chance to meet George H. W. Bush four years ago to promote a historical television show I was working on, he sexually assaulted me while I was posing for a similar photo,"" Lind wrote in a post Tuesday, according to CNN. ""He didn't shake my hand. He touched me from behind from his wheelchair with his wife Barbara Bush by his side. He told me a dirty joke. And then, all the while being photographed, touched me again."" Shortly after, New York actress Jordana Grolnick told Deadspin that the former president groped her during a photo op in August 2016 backstage at a Maine theater. ""We all circled around him and Barbara for a photo, and I was right next to him,"" Grolnick told the website. ""He reached his right hand around to my behind, and as we smiled for the photo he asked the group, 'Do you want to know who my favorite magician is?' As I felt his hand dig into my flesh, he said, 'David Cop-a-Feel!' "" Bush's spokesman Jim McGrath responded to the allegations with a statement — a ""non-apology apology"" — to multiple news organizations: ""At age 93, President Bush has been confined to a wheelchair for roughly five years, so his arm falls on the lower waist of people with whom he takes pictures. To try to put people at ease, the president routinely tells the same joke — and on occasion, he has patted women's rears in what he intended to be a good-natured manner. Some have seen it as innocent; others clearly view it as inappropriate. To anyone he has offended, President Bush apologizes most sincerely."" A flurry of sexual assault and harassment allegations against powerful men have emerged after The New York Times first reported on film mogul Harvey Weinstein paying off sexual harassment accusers. Since then multiple women have come forward and police in Los Angeles, New York and London are investigating allegations that Weinstein sexually assaulted women in those cities. At least 38 women have accused Hollywood writer and director James Toback of sexual harassment, according to the Los Angeles Times. Other prominent men in entertainment, media and politics have been accused of harassment as well; the accusations renew attention to the Access Hollywood recording of President Trump bragging about groping women, which was released just over one year ago. The reports have sparked a resurgence of women posting stories on social media about sexual assault and harassment using the ""#metoo"" hashtag.

The rapper became a star working with Dr. Dre on a song about killing an undercover cop for the 1992 film ""Deep Cover."" (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""DEEP COVER"") DR. DRE: (Rapping) Yeah, and you don't stop. SNOOP DOGG: (Rapping) Cause it's 1-8-7 on an undercover cop. Creep with me as I crawl though the hood. Maniac, lunatic... MARTIN: So it might seem a little odd to see Snoop Dogg reinvent himself now decades later as the host of a cooking show and a game show, but NPR TV critic Eric Deggans says Snoop pulls it off. ERIC DEGGANS, BYLINE: Back in the day, there was no job on TV more square than the game-show host. That's why it was so odd to turn on TBS's new game show and hear this. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""THE JOKER'S WILD"") UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: The only show wild enough to do it doggy style. It's ""The Joker's Wild."" DEGGANS: Snoop Dogg stars in a new version of ""The Joker's Wild,"" calibrated to speak to his expertise. Contestants answer questions in categories with names like Froback (ph) Thursday - that's identifying stars by their afros - and Name That Strain. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""THE JOKER'S WILD"") JEANNIE MAI: Now, Snoop's going to read you three names of weed, but which one is made up? DEGGANS: Snoop himself is a playful presence, cracking jokes centered on his penchant for consuming controlled substances - even when he gets a word wrong, as he did when naming several traditional songs in a clue. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""THE JOKER'S WILD"") SNOOP DOGG: Is it ""Dayenu,"" ""Hava Nagila"" or ""Hakuna Matata""? (LAUGHTER) SNOOP DOGG: You know they didn't give me no kind of class before I did this. You all got me out here just trying to figure it out. (APPLAUSE) SNOOP DOGG: Am I doing all right? MAI: That was good. UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: Yeah. DEGGANS: It's the kind of game show I would definitely waste a half-hour watching if I was home from work on a sick day. And this isn't the only TV show Snoop has on air right now. He's also co-starring with Martha Stewart in the Emmy-nominated - you heard right - Emmy-nominated cooking-slash-talk show on VH-1, ""Martha &amp; Snoop's Potluck Dinner Party."" (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""MARTHA &amp; SNOOP'S POTLUCK DINNER PARTY"") UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: (Singing) You're now cooking with Martha and Snoop. You're now cooking with Martha and Snoop. You're cooking. You're cooking. You're now cooking with Martha and Snoop. DEGGANS: It's a show where Stewart's stiff patrician vibe somehow plays well off Snoop Dogg's around-the-way style as they cook with celebrity guests. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""MARTHA &amp; SNOOP'S POTLUCK DINNER PARTY"") SNOOP DOGG: We need a cocktail like a dog needs a bone. So what are you making me tonight? MARTHA STEWART: Sangria - white sangria. SNOOP DOGG: Is that Hennessy? STEWART: Yes. SNOOP DOGG: Lord have mercy. (APPLAUSE) DEGGANS: Snoop's emergence as a genial TV host is made possible because we've kind of forgiven him for his past as a self-professed pimp and hustler. That history now informs Snoop Dogg's distinctive TV presence - genial but with a dangerous past. He's a lovable, roguish ambassador - an entertaining bridge between youth culture and the straight-laced world of game shows and Martha Stewart that few could have predicted back when he was slinging rhymes on Death Row Records.

npr,"October 23, 2017",Hollywood Director James Toback Accused Of Harassment By Dozens Of Women," Writer and director James Toback has become the latest Hollywood figure to be hit with allegations of sexual harassment. The Los Angeles Times reports that 38 women have claimed sexual harassment by Toback, who was Oscar-nominated for writing the 1991 film Bugsy, starring Warren Beatty. The Times reports: ""He prowled the streets of Manhattan looking for attractive young women, usually in their early 20s, sometimes college students, on occasion a high schooler. He approached them in Central Park, standing in line at a bank or drug store or at a copy center while they worked on their resumes."" He would drop names and titles of movies he'd worked on, according to the newspaper, which adds: ""Then, in a hotel room, a movie trailer, a public park, meetings framed as interviews or auditions quickly turned sexual, according to 38 women who, in separate interviews told the Los Angeles Times of similar encounters they had with Toback."" Toback, 72, has denied the allegations, saying he never met any of the women who have accused him, or if he did, it ""was for five minutes and (I) have no recollection,"" according to the Times. The newspaper says 31 of the 38 women who made accusations against Toback agreed to do so on the record. They include Louise Post, guitarist and vocalist for the band Veruca Salt and Terri Conn from the television soap opera As the World Turns. The latest allegations come close on the heels of those against producer Harvey Weinstein, who is accused of sexually assaulting and harassing at least three dozen women. As The Associated Press notes: ""Though less widely known than Weinstein, Toback has had a successful four-decade career in Hollywood and has a devoted following who have praised him for his originality and outsized, deeply flawed characters.""

npr,"October 23, 2017",David Letterman Honored With Twain Award For American Comedy," David Letterman, the longest-running late-night host in television — who gave us Stupid Pet Tricks, the Top Ten List and Larry ""Bud"" Melman — received the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts on Sunday night. Two years after retiring from CBS' Late Night with David Letterman, the once clean-shaven television comic now sports a bushy white beard, something fellow comedians couldn't resist poking fun at. ""Dave has always had spot-on comedic instinct,"" said Steve Martin, one of several comedians attending Sunday's presentation. ""What better time than right now to insist on looking like a Confederate war general?"" Letterman, 70, was born and raised in Indianapolis. He attended Ball State University, where he worked as a DJ for the college radio station. Later, Letterman got a job as a weatherman for WLWI in Indianapolis, but left for Los Angeles in 1975. There, he caught the attention of comedian Jimmie Walker, who hired Letterman to write jokes for his stand-up act. Following various minor spots on television, he began guest-hosting The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. And after a short-lived NBC morning comedy show, Letterman eventually landed the late-night slot with the network in 1982. He held it, first at NBC, then later at CBS, for a total of 33 years. Fellow late-night host Jimmy Kimmel said he and others learned to master the genre from watching Letterman. ""We know he's funny, probably the funniest. Inventive, too. He threw melons from a building,"" Kimmel said, referring to a routine in which Letterman tossed watermelons off a five-story rooftop. ""He did so many ridiculous things in the middle of the night,"" Kimmel said. In a videotaped message, former first lady Michelle Obama praised Letterman's ability to comfort viewers. ""No matter what was going on in our lives, we all knew that Dave would be there for us when we needed a laugh,"" she said. Bill Murray said winning the Mark Twain award would elevate Letterman above ordinary human beings. ""You're not exactly a god, but you're way up there,"" Murray said. ""You will be able to walk up to any man or woman on the street, take a lit cigar out of their mouth and finish it. You'll be able to board any riverboat in this country."" Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder performed the late Warren Zevon's ""Keep Me In Your Heart."" Letterman and Zevon, who performed numerous times on the show over the years, were good friends until the musician died of cancer in 2003. As NPR's Elizabeth Blair reports, when it was time for Letterman to make closing remarks at the ceremony, he thanked the ""hundreds and hundreds"" of people who helped him along the way. Letterman, who has been critical of President Trump in recent months, ended the night with a quote from Mark Twain: ""Patriotism is supporting your country all the time, and your government when it deserves it.""

npr,"October 22, 2017",Playboy Features First Transgender Playmate," INES RAU: Hello. Thanks for having me. I'm so excited. SINGH: It's a pleasure to have you on. Now, it should be said first that you are not the first transgender model, and you have already modeled in the magazine - in Playboy - before. RAU: Yes, I did. SINGH: So why is this considered such a significant move? RAU: Well, I'm very honored to be part of making progress towards a more loving and accepting world. This is as heavy as it is because it's not about just being in the magazine. They really wanted me as a Playmate. I think they wanted to stand for a cause and for a message. I know that Hugh Hefner was very sensitive to - was an advocate of freedom and sexual liberation and always fought for LGBT as well. I know he was fighting for same-sex marriage before and everything. So I think it's good. SINGH: Going through the shift, going through the change of having to, first, deal with everything that's involved with being transgender - facing of the stigma - stigma in your community - from that point to arriving here where you have exposed yourself to millions of people to accept you for who you are, give me an idea of what that transformation has been like for you. RAU: You know, it's really like a constant fight - you fight with yourself. You fight with society. But it's so worth it. I'm super happy. And I feel very lucky to be a model and to be the one who has been chosen for Playboy because I feel like a magazine like Playboy is like putting a crown of immunity on my head. And for transgender to feel - what's the word - I'm sorry. I'm French. Sometimes, I'm looking for my words - to feel legit as a woman. You know, when I was younger, I had no one to look up to make me feel good and worth being. So if I can be the one to make all transgender people feel worth being, worth loving, this is an amazing thing. SINGH: Let me ask you also - Hugh Hefner's death in September has prompted much debate. On the one hand, some see him as a progressive leader for free speech and civil rights. Others said he fostered a culture of misogyny and manipulation. What are your thoughts on all of those points? RAU: So everybody has the right to have their opinion about Mr. Hugh Hefner. The way I see him is, as you said before, a progressist and an advocate of freedom. So that's the way I see it. SINGH: How are you hoping your new-found recognition - how do you see this as championing a movement? RAU: You know, I think that it means that people will be more accepting and, more importantly, for future generation, that would be something that would be more normal because everybody deserves to feel good in their skin, you know. Everybody deserves to be happy. SINGH: Ines Rau will be featured in Playboy, which hits stands on October 31. Thank you so much for speaking with us, Ines. RAU: Thank you so much.

Now, she stars in the BET show Being Mary Jane, as a powerful cable news anchor who's equally fierce in her personal life. She's also an advocate for rape survivors and an outspoken voice on many issues. And she's just written her first book, a collection of essays called We're Going to Need More Wine. Union says she's always loved regaling her friends about her adventures and misadventures — hence the title of her book. ""I'll be like, 'Girl, you don't have enough wine,'"" she says. ""A lot of these stories are helpful with a cocktail, for sure."" A lot of these stories are helpful with a cocktail, for sure. Gabrielle Union She's never been a fan of celebrity tell-alls. ""To narc on your costars, I think is kinda tacky,"" she says. But in her book, Union does dish about how dreamy it was to work with actor Heath Ledger. She reminisces about parties Prince used to throw. And she calls out her ex-husband, retired NFL running back Chris Howard, talking about her regret that after they divorced, she paid his rent, cosigned for a Porsche he later abandoned, and invested in a company he started that failed. ""Had he paid up, perhaps I would have been kinder. Or omitted some of his truth, or our truth,"" she sighs. ""But, alas, his bill is outstanding, and — sorry."" Union's memoir is funny and frank about many things. Mostly, herself: She details losing her virginity, sexual encounters, cheating, infertility, miscarriages. In one essay, she describes being raped at gunpoint by a stranger in the back room of a shoe store where she worked. She was 19. ""It's weird to say, and it's awful to have to say that I had the luxury of being raped in an affluent community with an underworked police department and an underutilized rape crisis center, counselors who had gone through the sensitivity training,"" she says. ""And to be immediately afforded the sympathy that accompanies stranger rape, to be immediately supported, and immediately put on the path to healing."" Stories That Are Funny, Complicated, and True by Gabrielle Union Hardcover, 262 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? Union credits the Santa Monica-UCLA rape treatment center for saving her life. But the incident still affects her. ""I talk about the sense of rape energy that has continued to swirl around me, things happening to me that are out of my control,"" she says. ""And then in the microcosm of Hollywood, being put in the situation where you're not supposed to have any boundaries. You're supposed to be grateful if your fans want to be around you or touch you or grope you or yank you around, and all of that is supposed to just be par for the course."" Union says her goal has never hearing the words ""me too"" again, but sexual assault is far too common. Her experience motivated her to take on a role in the film Birth of a Nation, about the 1831 slave rebellion led by Nat Turner. She plays Esther, a slave who's raped by a drunken dinner party guest at a plantation. While the character was silent, the actress who portrayed her was not — especially after it was revealed that the film's director and actor Nate Parker had been charged with rape while he was a college student. Although he was acquitted, Union says she could not take the allegations against him lightly. She wrote about it in an op-ed piece for the L.A. Times, adding that she had conflicting feelings about promoting Parker's film, ""because there were so many women and so many people associated with the film that were sexual assault survivors, I thought it was important to highlight those stories,"" she says. ""It just became an impossible situation. And also offering understanding for people who did not want to support the film — I absolutely understand that. I hope as someone who was in the film, as well as other survivors that our art could be recognized as well."" Union doesn't go into the Nate Parker controversy in her book, but she has many things to say about racism. She born into one of the largest and oldest black families in Nebraska, then grew up in Pleasanton, a white, liberal suburb in the San Francisco Bay Area. ""As the chip in the cookie, what I found over and over and over again is that the more I assimilated, the more they forgot my blackness, and they just got very comfortable in their racism,"" she recalls. ... what I found over and over and over again is that the more I assimilated, the more they forgot my blackness, and they just got very comfortable in their racism. Gabrielle Union Union says growing up, she was constantly called the n-word. Years later, she worries about what her two stepsons in Florida face. ""Raising teenage black boys, and watching them going from being regarded as ""'Oh my god, they're so cute' to [she gasps] 'They're a threat just by breathing,'"" Union says. ""And it's terrifying in Florida, where not only do you have to worry about the police, you have to worry about how your neighbors are regarding you."" In her book, the 44-year-old actress also reflects on her career, which began with the 1990s sitcom Saved By the Bell: The New Class. ""I started playing 14 and 15-year-olds when I was 23, finishing up at UCLA. And I continued to play 15-year-olds until I was 30. You know I'm dying my greys and reporting to high school."" With her ever-youthful look and trademark dimples, Union got bit parts on TV shows like Moesha, Friends, and Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. ""My mom is and was a massive Trekkie,"" she says.""So being a Klingon in my family was akin to winning the Oscars."" Union also acted in such films as Ten Things I Hate About You, Deliver Us From Eva and Bad Boys II. One of her best known roles was a high school cheerleader named Isis in the 2000 movie Bring it On. For the championships, Isis goes up against Kirsten Dunst's character and gets labelled a mean girl (unfairly, in Union's opinion). Years later, the actress had an ""aha"" moment about her own behavior. She made a startling confession while accepting the Essence Fierce and Fearless Award in 2013. ""I lived for the negativity inflicted upon my sister actresses, or anyone who I felt whose shine diminished my own,"" she said from the podium. Oprah Winfrey was in the audience, and was inspired by Union's candor. On a television special, Winfrey told her, ""As you started to speak, my own mouth dropped and then got wider and wider, and by the time you finished we were all like, whoa. What was that?"" Union says this was another moment in her evolution of becoming a better person.""That came on the heels of a lot of therapy, a lot of life coaching and just wanting to change the narrative about black women in Hollywood. And just being honest."" That introspection, and a willingness to change, is central to Gabrielle Union's memoir — and her life.

He has two Oscars. He's played astronauts and soldiers and a widower sending up his voice like a signal flare. He's directed and produced and written films and TV projects, and now he's written a book of short stories, called Uncommon Type. One of those stories, as it happens, is about an actor forced to endure a punishing overseas press junket for a film in which he isn't even the star. It's safe to say this is based on experience. Nevertheless, we forged ahead and talked about not only writing and performing, but also the cosmos, the inner lives of parents, why he resists the traditional notion of the ""bucket list,"" and whether there's anything left for humankind to aspire to that's as tantalizing and potentially unifying as going to the moon. And yes, if you stay tuned, he will tell you quite a remarkable piece of trivia about a very well-known suit he wore last year around this time. But we begin, as we must, with Tom Hanks saying what you can only hope every interview will be about: the words, ""Well, let me tell you something."" On dedicating the book, in part, to Nora Ephron: ""I wrote some things for newspaper articles and whatnot, and I would always send it to Nora, and she would respond instantaneously. Sometimes I would say, 'Is this a thing? Have I written something here?' And she says, 'Yes, you've written an essay. You should send it to The New York Times, but for the Style section. Not the Sunday, the Thursday Style section ...' So I'd follow that through, but she would also then go through it and she would point out things like an editor would do, but she would also — there was one time she sent me back this thing and it just had four words on it: 'Voice, voice, voice, voice.' I understand what you're saying, but I don't get how you're saying it. What is your voice? ... Nora was the person who said, 'You have written, whether you know it or not.'"" On the meaning of the moon: ""Going to the moon, for an entire generation of people on the planet Earth, was a very specific goal that was going to define all of humanity. Not just the Soviets versus America — when humankind was going to figure out how to fly all the way up there and then come back, we would have achieved this evolutionary place, as a species. That means that's how smart we were. And that's how powerful our imaginations were. That's a demonstration of what our wherewithal was. All the choices that would go into that. Whether we got anything great, whether they discovered gold up there or little green men, it wasn't going to matter. ... When that happened, we were going to be another whole type of creature in the cosmos. We were capable of doing that. I think that's a pretty cool thing."" On your kids growing up: ""There's a time when you can invest, and the investment is really important, but there's a moment when that bill comes due, and off they go. And the only thing you can really do is stay in, sort of like, constant contact and support for what your kids are going through. It comes along right about the time they figure out the same thing about me as I figured out about my parents — [which] is that they were wrestling with stuff that ... I had no idea. And that's just the way it is. There's not a negative aspect to it."" On life in Hollywood at the moment: ""We are in, I think, year 12 of the most savage change in the motion picture industry. The only thing that has not gone away and is an absolute constant and will forever be is an audience that wants to be surprised.

npr,"October 17, 2017",Taran Killam Says 'There Was Never Any Common Ground' When Trump Hosted 'SNL'," Taran Killam wrote, directed and stars in the mockumentary Killing Gunther. When the ""On Air"" lights went dark in NBC's Studio 8H early on Sunday, May 21, Taran Killam didn't realize he had just performed on Saturday Night Live for the last time. Later that summer, after six seasons of his seven-year contract, NBC didn't ask him back. ""It wasn't super negative,"" he tells NPR's It's Been A Minute. ""It was just kind of messy."" Killam's final season was one of SNL's most successful. The show emerged as a voice in the 2016 campaign, though not without controversy. When Donald Trump was invited to host in November 2015, protesters gathered outside NBC's New York studio. ""We could hear the protests during our table read,"" Killam remembers. ""As we're reading 40 mediocre sketches, we just hear, 'No Trump! Donald Trump!' ... I am embarrassed, upon reflection, just because of how everyone was right. Every person outside of that building protesting was absolutely right."" Since then, Killam has been busy. Earlier this year, he played King George III in Broadway's Hamilton. He says that while SNL prepared him for performing live, ""I was probably more nervous than I've ever been, for anything, to do Hamilton."" Now he also has a new film. Killing Gunther is a mockumentary action-comedy that Killam wrote, directed and stars in (alongside Arnold Schwarzenegger). He says, ""I wanted it to be something entirely original, and entirely representing all things that I love. ... I love assassins and silly, stupid comedy."" On directing for the first time  I think it probably was the hardest thing I've ever done. ... The orientation I would give each new hire, each new department head or crew member, was, ""It's my first time and I don't know as much as you. I know what I would like this movie to be. But I look to you to collaborate with me to tell me when I'm wrong, and I promise that I will listen to that and always take it into consideration and only push back if I feel strongly about something."" In every creative conversation we had, I ultimately put my foot in my mouth somehow, not knowing some simple logistical thing that, had I gone to film school, I would have known — or the requirements, budgetarily or logistically, of space, of unions, of schedule. But it was so fulfilling because to get to be at the center and a part of something ... not many people get that opportunity. So I'm incredibly grateful. On what it was like when candidate Trump hosted SNL It was rough. It was not enjoyable at the time and something that only grows more embarrassing and shameful as time goes on. I don't necessarily put so much weight into [the idea of] Trump hosting SNL helping him become president, but there's definitely something where it normalizes him and it makes it OK for him to be part of the conversation. And I don't think the intention of having him on was ever politically based. I sincerely believe that. But I don't think it was considered — the implications that it had then and could have moving forward. And I think looking back ... there's nothing good I can take from that week. Because he's not an enjoyable person to be around — he's from a different class; he's from a different way of life. There was never any common ground. ... The most heartbreaking moment at the time: We're at the host dinner, and he brings [his wife] Melania and he brings [his daughter] Ivanka and [son-in-law] Jared [Kushner]. And he says [to SNL creator Lorne Michaels], ""You know, Lorne, if I don't win this thing, I'm gonna be fine. We just bought this beautiful piece of property in Scotland. If I have to be president, I'm never gonna see that thing."" And that that was his priority in that moment, that that was even a consideration, made me sad. On SNL becoming a voice of opposition to Trump  It certainly feels like there's some hypocrisy there. I guess you could say, ""Oh, they're righting wrongs."" And I don't even think it's righting wrongs. I think the show tries to — and in particular, Lorne's outlook is — play to both sides. Play to the masses, play to whatever the popular opinion is. But, boy, they could definitely mine some comedy out of owning up to it, huh? On why Drake was one of his favorite SNL hosts He is absolutely the theater nerd/actor kid that you first saw on Degrassi, and yet authentically — in this culture and as an artist — a master of hip-hop. And it was fascinating because he was kind and well-mannered and polite to everybody. He was in on the joke; he was bringing something to it and just full of charisma and fully relatable. And then the second time he hosted, he wanted to host the after-after-party ... [at] Dave &amp; Busters. And apparently he frequents, or could be a co-owner, of a strip club out of Toronto and flew down much or most or all of the staff — all the ladies there who work under the Drake corporation. And it was so funny to look around at this Dave &amp; Busters open at 3 in the morning and see 40 nerdy, comedian writer-performers walking around [with] easily 50 to 60 strippers who are dancing and grinding. We literally saw two strippers get in a fight, and one pulled the other's weave out of her hair. And we just wanted to play the Jurassic Park game. ... [That was] Batman Drake. We had Bruce Wayne Drake [on the show], and this is Batman. On whether he would have wanted an on-air send-off, as some departing cast members receive It's organized chaos, and there are going to be causalities. Of course. Certainly. And I will say, for better or for worse, [I] got to kind of vicariously feel it through the two people I was maybe the most close with: When Bobby [Moynihan] and Vanessa [Bayer] got their proper send-off, it genuinely made me happy. It's comedy college, and you're always an alumni. And people who I absolutely love and admire and respect were sent off even less ceremoniously, and people who I was very close to on the show while I was there were let go, or not held on to or not given the appropriate chance that I think they deserved. And that's just part of the show. It's organized chaos, and there are going to be causalities. NPR thanks our sponsors Become an NPR sponsor ",http://www.npr.org/558160262
npr,"October 16, 2017","In The Wake Of Harvey Weinstein Scandal, Women Say #MeToo"," The news of Harvey Weinstein's expulsion from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences over the weekend is prompting victims to share their own experiences of sexual harassment and assault. The academy ousted the powerful Hollywood producer over multiple abuse allegations, prompting social media users around the world to proclaim a simple idea: that sexual abuse is a common experience in women's lives. Who hasn't? #MeToo The tweets and other social media posts — mostly from women, but also other survivors — describe a culture of silence around sexual assault. #MeToo The amount of shame and shaming around sexual assault is terrible. I'm healed... praying tonight for all of those sharing. https://t.co/Zy3xHSRlPK Others condense traumatic moments into 140 characters. The 2nd time I was raped was my last yr of grad school. I never reported it, I just concealed my injuries &amp; taught the next morning. #MeToo Miranda Yaver of New Haven, Conn., said she began talking more about her assault in the wake of the Access Hollywood video released just before Donald Trump was elected President last year, in which he can be heard bragging about touching women's genitals without consent. ""I think that when you see more and more powerful people in Hollywood and business, etc, coming out and saying that this isn't acceptable or that this happened to them, I think that [it] becomes easier for us to voice our concerns,"" Yaver said. The hashtag #metoo emerged over the weekend after Weinstein's ouster, when it was picked up by celebrities and thousands of social media users. Megan Nobert, an abuse survivor and founder of a nonprofit focused on sexual assault of humanitarian aid workers, pointed out how pervasive harassment and assault has been in her life. #MeTooMore times than I can count. In the workplace. At school. On the street. In spaces I should have been able to feel safe. Nobert said the fact that this scandal involves Hollywood celebrities has emboldened some victims to speak out on social media. ""When it's somebody that you see on TV, in the media, on movies, people that you admire, that you think are interesting and funny and attractive – and it happened to them – it makes it suddenly more real,"" she said. Leigh Gilmore, a women's and gender studies professor at Wellesley College, said the high-profile nature of the Weinstein scandal is bringing needed attention to the issue of sexual abuse, but it's not enough. She's also author of the book Tainted Witness: Why We Doubt What Women Say About Their Lives.  ""This is about refuting a toxic culture of violence that's larger than any particular male predator like Harvey Weinstein,"" Gilmore said. ""And I hope we don't miss our chance to really make some kind of transformation in daily life about sexual abuse and sexual harassment by simply scapegoating one powerful man."" Moments like this that can mark cultural shifts, said Lisa Huebner, associate professor of women's and gender studies at West Chester University of Pennsylvania. ""I think it's gonna be one of those moments in time that we will look back on,"" she said. ""It helps a lot of people individually, I think, and it also will help us to mark publicly that this is a widespread occurrence, and it's not okay.""

npr,"October 16, 2017","In His 15th Season At 'SNL,' Kenan Thompson Still Knows How To Play It Funny"," It was an odd sketch, tucked near the end of Saturday Night Live's season premiere, long after Alec Baldwin's crowd-pleasing Trump imitation and two performances by Jay-Z. Actor Ryan Gosling played a soft-spoken rock flutist performing with a motley trio in a run-down bar. He gets a call from the police during the show, and has to tell his bandmate/roommate that his good jeans have been stolen. There was only one reason the sketch was even nominally funny: Kenan Thompson. At a rehearsal the Thursday before SNL's premiere, Gosling and SNL cast member Kyle Mooney pretended to play flute and keyboard while real musicians provided the notes offstage. Thompson, meanwhile, gave notes on how to balance that fakery with their lines for maximum impact, guiding the scene as much as the show's actual director. That preparation, professionalism and instinct for the funny has allowed Thompson to survive on SNL for 15 seasons — longer than any other performer in the show's history. This season, he edges ahead of impressionist Darrell Hammond to become the show's longest-serving cast member. But ask how he pulled it off — how he has stayed so funny for so long — and Thompson doesn't really have an answer. ""Man, I wish I could say,"" he offers, relaxing in his closet-sized dressing room at SNL's studio in Rockefeller Center while his longtime barber gives him a touch up. ""It was a blessing just to get the job, you know what I mean? Everything is so up in the air week by week, year by year in a place like this."" Two days before the first show of the season, the atmosphere backstage at SNL is like the first day back at school after summer vacation. There's a lot of anticipation: Last season was SNL's most successful in decades, with a big win at the Emmy Awards for best variety sketch show. According to Thompson, the show clicked with viewers because their take on the Trump administration was just what the audience was thinking. ""Everybody was on the same page, that's what it was,"" he says. ""When everybody's on the same page, everybody can hear the joke coming, and they can enjoy it when it lands."" Thompson says being part of the cast last season was a singular experience, even for someone with 14 years on SNL's stage. ""To see Alec Baldwin as Trump getting a standing ovation — it was kind of weird,"" Thompson adds. ""Because it's like they're cheering for Alec, I think. ...They were cheering for his impression and what it's doing for the world. We're healing a lot of wounds that people have to live with throughout their day. And they finally get to a Saturday night, and they patch it up a little bit and go back to Monday."" Soft spoken and humble, Thompson doesn't say much about his own performances, but SNL co-head writer Bryan Tucker (who has written for Chris Rock and Dave Chappelle) has a few ideas. ""He's always a guy who cast members can look to ... because he's going to know how to play it funny right away,"" Tucker says. ""... I think the biggest thing it takes [to survive at SNL] is to have your own distinct voice that other people don't do, and then a willingness to ... do what we call 'playing service' — stepping aside and letting someone else be the star. And when you come in [with] your three or four lines, you make them count."" Flourishing at SNL is legendarily tough. Chris Rock didn't make much of an impression over three seasons; Jim Carrey and Kevin Hart didn't even get hired when they auditioned. It's important to have a distinct voice; to click with the material, the audience and the times. Thompson found his voice in 2009 with a sketch called ""What Up With That?"" It was a fake talk show on BET with three random guests (the first trio included James Franco as himself and Bill Hader as Lindsey Buckingham) who wait for Thompson, as host Diondre Cole, to finish singing the theme song. But the joke is that Thompson never really stops. He's surrounded by a growing succession of oddball background players — Jason Sudeikis as a track suit-wearing dancer, Fred Armisen as a saxophonist who looks suspiciously like Kenny G. After years of struggle, the sketch was a triumph for Thompson. And according to Tucker, his co-workers knew it. ""He finished, the audience clapped,"" Tucker says. ""And then he went out into the hallway to change and a bunch of SNL staff — people from wardrobe, people from makeup, lighting, stagehands — were all kind of lined up on the wall, and they all kind of applauded and gave him a high-five. ... It's pretty rare I see that at SNL, that everybody just decides we're going to acknowledge this for one person. And it was kind of a celebration of Kenan."" Since then, Thompson has become one of the best sketch comedy actors on television. He consistently knows how to score a laugh in sketches, sometimes just by making a face. His likeability is his secret weapon. ""Sometimes when a writer just needs a joke in the sketch, or a laugh, you can write in the action line, 'Kenan reacts,' "" Tucker says with a laugh. ""It's kind of a cheat, but we know it'll work, so sometimes we get lazy and do it. ... He's just a guy you see and you like and he just knows how to play those moments."" Thompson, an Atlanta native, says his work as a teen in local theater provided valuable early training. His skills were sharpened further on the kid-centered network Nickelodeon — first as a star on the mid-'90s sketch comedy show All That and then on a little sitcom called Kenan &amp; Kel. ""I was always very professional in the approach to this,"" Thompson says. ""... It was never about what this could bring me. It was always just about servicing whatever project I was doing."" In 2003, Thompson joined SNL as the youngest cast member, and the first born after the show's 1975 debut. Now, at 39, he's SNL's second-oldest cast member. Thompson's one spot of controversy in 15 seasons came from a 2013 interview with TV Guide which touched on the lack of black women in the cast. He had decided he wasn't going to play black women on the show anymore, after realizing roles like Whoopi Goldberg, Star Jones and Carol Moseley Braun were half the parts he was playing. But he says his quote about black women who audition for SNL — ""they just never find ones that are ready"" — was taken out of context. ""There's not a lot of black women in improv houses that Saturday Night Live chooses from,"" Thompson says, citing performance troupes like Upright Citizens Brigade and The Groundlings as pipelines for performers trained in sketch comedy and improv. Controversy over the lack of black women, which sparked protests and analysis columns, eventually led the show's producers to hold specific auditions. They hired Sasheer Zamata and writer LaKendra Tookes, who have both since left the show, and current cast member Leslie Jones. Thompson also shrugs off criticism that the show tends to feature broader depictions of black people, sometimes verging on stereotypes. He says SNL performers are creating characters based on things they've observed, things that feel comfortable to them. He does worry, though, about how many black artists use the N-word in their work. He's unconvinced its pejorative meaning can be reclaimed. ""It's just weird to hear that word come flying out of anybody's mouth,"" Thompson says. ""Anybody with any kind of sense of history, it just sends chills down your spine whenever you hear it. It pushed me off of listening to a lot of my serious hip-hop stations because they just let it fly."" SNL writer Bryan Tucker is surprised Thompson hasn't found bigger stardom like former castmates Tina Fey, Fred Armisen and Kristen Wiig. ""Frankly, I often get a little frustrated that he hasn't broken out past the SNL bubble, because I think he's always good in whatever he is in,"" Tucker says. ""And he has this thing where you just like him no matter what he does, and I feel like that could translate to lots of other things."" But Thompson doesn't cite the work of huge stars when asked what he'd like to do next. Instead, he evokes uber-producers like Brian Grazer and J.J. Abrams. (His explanation: They make more money than most journeyman actors). A devoted husband and father, he's less concerned with superstardom than steady, quality work. Perhaps that's another reason he's lasted longer than anyone else in one of the toughest jobs in show business. NPR thanks our sponsors Become an NPR sponsor ",http://www.npr.org/557572303
npr,"October 15, 2017","'SNL' Goes After 'Well-Dressed Skin Tag' Weinstein, Stages Pence Walkouts"," After the show's silence on the Harvey Weinstein allegations last week, the pressure was on for Saturday Night Live to tackle Hollywood's sexual assault problem. People on social media quickly criticized the comedy staple for not addressing the glaring news in its earlier episode, after the New York Times' bombshell report dropped the previous Thursday. Many construed the void as a continuation of a pattern within the entertainment industry of protecting its Harvey Weinsteins and the Bill Cosbys. In fact, two Weinstein jokes had been cut because they reportedly didn't play well with the dress rehearsal audience: ""It's a New York thing,"" Lorne Michaels told a Daily Mail reporter. But this Saturday, the show devoted ample time to the topic. Acknowledging that it's ""hard to make jokes about sexual assault,"" Michael Che resorted to softer targets, making fun of the movie mogul's appearance. ""Doesn't he look like a well-dressed skin tag?"" Che says in the Weekend Update segment. He did come around to sharper jabs, though, attacking Weinstein's excuse for his behavior: ""It's not a mistake — It's like a full season of Law &amp; Order."" Colin Jost said that ""he doesn't need sex rehab — he needs a specialized facility where there are no women, no contact with the outside world, metal bars ... and it's a prison."" An all-female roundtable sketch managed to wrench some funny out of the bigger issue: rape culture, and Hollywood's enabling of it. In a New York Film Festival panel featuring Marion Cotillard (Cecily Strong), Viola Davis (Leslie Jones) and Kate McKinnon's fictional aging actress Debette Goldry, moderator Aidy Bryant asks if there's some sort of ""whisper system"" practiced by women in Hollywood to warn one another of sexual predators. Yes, Goldry says: ""The code was 'He raped me.' That way, if any men were listening they'd tune us right out."" McKinnon strays from her character's tone as Goldry closes the skit on a serious note. ""Violence against women doesn't just happen to famous actress, it's everywhere, damn it,"" she says. ""It's about time we take it seriously. Pandora's Box is open now, and Pandora is pissed."" Predictably, Alec Baldwin's President Trump kicked off the cold open. In between addressing Puerto Rico, his ""magnificent tax plan"" and his feud with Rex Tillerson, Trump pauses several times to check in with Beck Bennett's Vice President Mike Pence. After the president claimed responsibility for Pence's walkout from an NFL game last week for kneeling players ""disrespecting our anthem, flag and country,"" Baldwin's Trump pulls Pence's strings to boycott more events. At the direction of Trump, Pence walks out of an Indiana Pacers game, a Starbucks and a same-sex wedding. Trump commands Pence to inspect the Starbucks seasonal cups. It may be October, but — ""Get out of there, Mike!"" — the ""Pumpkin spice is back"" campaign still disrespects ""our Lord and savior Santa Claus,"" Trump says. ""We're going to start saying 'Merry Christmas' again."" Michael Che offers a rejoinder to this point on Weekend Update: ""When we say 'Happy Holidays' we're not attacking Christmas, we're saying 'All Holidays Matter,' "" Che says. In a pre-taped It parody, Anderson Cooper finds out where Kellyanne Conway's been hiding — and what lands her back on TV. Sewer-dwelling Kellywise The Dancing Clown (and McKinnon at her best) begs the CNN host to ""put me on TV,"" even morphing into Hillary Clinton to lure Cooper into the gutter. Flashing newspaper headlines like ""Trump Re-elected To Second Term,"" this Pennywise tries to tap into Cooper's deepest fears. Comedian and The Big Sick actor-writer Kumail Nanjiani used his first-time hosting gig to attack racism in his monologue. Islamophobia ""is really having a moment right now,"" he says. It's ""kind of like Will &amp; Grace. It was huge a while ago, and then we thought it was gone and done — and now it's back and bigger than ever! Thursdays on NBC."" But Nanjiani jokes that his biggest problem with racists is their inaccuracy. ""If someone yells at me, 'go back to India', I'd be like, 'that guy's an idiot'. But if someone was like, 'go back to Pakistan, which was part of India until 1947 and is now home to the world's oldest salt mine,' I would be like 'that guy seems to know what he's talking about. I'll pack my bags.' "" ""Just because you're racist, doesn't mean you have to be ignorant,"" Nanjiani concludes. ""An informed racist is a better racist.""

npr,"October 13, 2017","On Halloween, Insensitivity Goes Beyond Kimonos And Black Face"," Never mind ghosts and goblins, zombies and vampires. For some people, the scariest part of Halloween is the deluge of offensive costumes, from frat boys in black face to white kids in kimonos to sexy celebrity Pocahontases. At this point, every masquerader (should) know that race is not a costume. But the racial politics behind certain get-ups aren't quite so obvious. This week on Ask Code Switch, we got a question from Jennifer, a Pennsylvania woman whose daughter is entranced with the occult. The costume in question? Voodoo doll. Here's Jennifer:  My 9-year-old daughter (half German-American, half Jewish-American) saw a voodoo doll costume she wants to wear for Halloween. It's styled modestly, is pretty while still being a little ""ghoulish,"" and isn't commercial or political — all of which make it attractive to me. But I don't know enough about Louisiana culture or African religious traditions to know whether this would hurt or offend someone. My daughter says voodoo was in The Princess and the Frog, so it must be OK. But I know Disney has messed up in the past. Can you help? Halloweeners, read on: Hi Jennifer, I totally get why your daughter wants to be a voodoo doll. It's spookier than a princess, more creative than a ghost, not as played out as a witch. I understand why it's appealing to you, too. (Although I wouldn't go so far as to say it's not political.) But your instinct that there might be something off? Dead-on. To understand why, it helps to have a little background about what exactly ""voodoo"" is. That is actually much more complicated than you might think. The term ""voodoo"" is often used as a catchall for several distinct, but related religions that combine elements of Catholicism and West African Vodun. There are different variations of Voodoo (Vodun, Vodou, Hoodoo, Vaudou) practiced in Louisiana, Brazil, the Dominican Republic and Cuba. But the most well-known, at least in American popular imagination, is Haitian Vodou. Vodou is one of Haiti's official religions. It was created by enslaved Africans and their descendants, who came in contact with Roman Catholic missionaries in the 1500s and 1600s. The religion's ""fundamental principle is that everything is spirit. Humans are spirits who inhabit the visible world, and other spirits ... populate the unseen world."" That's according to the Encyclopedia Brittanica, in an entry written by Elizabeth McAlister. She is a professor of religion and the author of a book about Haitian Vodou, called Rara! Vodou, Power, and Performance in Haiti and Its Diaspora.) But Jennifer, most Americans know nothing about Vodou as an actual religion. What we know about is the pop culture version: what a scholar named Adam McGee refers to as ""lower case 'v' voodoo"" — that witchy, bloodletting revenge stuff from New Orleans. (Again, that's not to be confused with Louisiana Voodoo, a real religion practiced by many.) That kind of voodoo, with the dolls and the zombies, is what you see in movies like Indiana Jones or Princess and the Frog. White Zombie, a 1932 horror film, was one of the first movies to establish a set of racial tropes about Haitian Vodou — voodoo dolls among them. McGee writes that the voodoo we see in the movies was lightly inspired by religion but is primarily the brainchild of Hollywood producers and long ago travel writers. And it has a very specific purpose: ""This imagined religion serves as a venue for the expression of more-or-less undiluted racial anxieties, manifested as lurid fantasies about black peoples. ... ""As something that is coded as black, presenting voodoo in scenarios that are belittling, denigrating and, most especially, aimed to evoke terror is a way of directing these sentiments at blacks without openly entering into racist discourse."" So, back to voodoo dolls. As you might imagine, they have no real connection to Haitian Vodou. Kyrah Malika Daniels, a professor of of art history, African &amp; African Diaspora Studies, and theology at Boston College, says she sometimes sees the dolls being sold in places like the checkout line at Barnes &amp; Noble. And for her, that serves as ""this small reminder that any exposure we have to black religion that is not Christianity is satanic. Is devilish. Is something to be feared."" ""This is incredibly damaging to so many devotees of African and African-derived religions who have been able to rely upon these traditions for faith, for community, for healing purposes,"" Daniels says. To put all of this in context, Daniels says, think about what it might look like if you subbed out Vodou for Christianity and used it as a Halloween costume: ""If we were to consider how Christians might feel if somebody were to dress up as a gruesome, gory, bloody Jesus, hanging from a cross — what would that look like? Would that not be offensive?"" Daniels adds that what is even more profound about this ""is that a gory representation of Jesus, while perhaps quite offensive, would not be inaccurate. It actually is a component of the religion. Whereas the voodoo doll is not."" I think that about says it. So, what should you tell your daughter? Haitian Vodou and Louisiana Voodoo are fascinating religions, and if she seems interested in learning more about them, there are some great resources available. But when it comes to Halloween, treat Vodou like you would any other faith. That is to say, don't delve into anyone else's religious traditions (real or dreamed up by Hollywood) in search of a costume. But hey — if you're still in need of something to wear on Halloween, an unofficial poll of everyone I know suggests that regular old dolls are creepy enough as is. Happy haunting!

It's not uncommon for comics to be influenced by depression, anxiety or troubled childhoods, but Tonight Show host Jimmy Fallon insists his comedy doesn't come from a dark place. ""I was always a happy kid,"" Fallon says. ""I remember there was a report card from kindergarten and the comment from the teacher was, 'Jimmy smiles too much,' which was very interesting. ... I think I would smile even when I was getting yelled at."" by Jimmy Fallon and Miguel Ordóñez Hardcover, 40 | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? That tendency to smile has stayed with Fallon. On The Tonight Show, his brand of humor is decidedly upbeat — even during tragic news cycles. ""We follow the news on most channels ... and then it's our job to make fun of whatever we can make fun of, and just make you laugh as you doze off,"" Fallon says. ""That's kind of my goal: My goal is that you have sweet dreams."" Fallon also has a new children's book, Everything is MAMA, which is a follow-up to his 2015 book, Your Baby's First Word Will Be DADA. The father of two says he loves being a dad and especially enjoys reading with his young daughters: ""It's really interesting. I'm literally watching someone learn how to read in front of me."" On the acting class he took when he was getting started I go in and I was really into James Dean at the time. ... I read all these biographies. James Dean never acted in his acting class, he just observed. I go, ""Oh, how cool! That is so James Dean and cool."" So I would go to [the] class, I'd pay money — which I didn't have — but I'd pay money for this class, and I would say, ""No, I just want to observe."" And I'd sit in the back of the class and just watch the acting class. [The teacher] was like, ""Jimmy, are you sure? I mean, you should just get down here and just try."" And I'd go, ""No, I'm good. I'm good. I'm just gonna observe!"" ... So I kind of just did that. I didn't really act in the acting class and it really paid off, as you can see in my movie roles. On how his time on Saturday Night Live taught him to pay attention to detail The thing I love about Saturday Night Live is the attention to detail that's not even part of the sketch. They'll do a sketch about, I don't know, Roosevelt, and they'll show all these paintings of ships in the back, because Roosevelt had this one room where people kept giving him paintings of ships for some reason. So it's not part of the sketch, but if you're a fan of Franklin D. Roosevelt you'll see there's paintings of ships in the back of a sketch, and you go, ""Oh, that's a deep cut!"" It's not part of the sketch, it's just attention to details. So little things like that, I always think of when we're doing our show, like, could that be better? Would that be the microphone they use in 1983? ... Those little details I freak out about. I love looking at that, and so does our crew and our wardrobe and our hair department. On receiving criticism for asking candidate Donald Trump if he could tousle his hair on The Tonight Show  I don't really know how to deal with this presidency, so I'm kind of learning as I'm going. The hair mess thing, you know, I asked him questions — as hard-hitting questions as I'm going to ask. I asked him if he knew Vladimir Putin. I asked him did he have any contact with him, was he friends with him. I asked him those questions. It doesn't get brought up, because everyone just saw the hair thing and they go, ""Ugh! I can't believe he messed his hair up and showed how cool he was."" I'm like, ""I don't know if that's a cool thing."" I don't really know how to deal with this presidency, so I'm kind of learning as I'm going.  Jimmy Fallon If I went up to you and messed your hair up, is that cool? I don't know. ... I touched the guy's hair that everyone wanted to touch. Everyone's like, ""Is it real? Is it a toupee? What is it? What's underneath there? What is going on?"" On almost losing his finger to ring avulsion  I tripped and fell in my kitchen. [I was] just running around, and I put my hand on the countertop to catch my fall and my wedding ring got caught on the sharp edge of my countertop. I fell down, but my ring ... didn't move it all. ... It just ripped the whole end of my finger off, tendons and everything. I didn't know what had happened and I just saw blood coming out. ... I wrapped a dishtowel around my hand and ran in a cab and went to the emergency room. ... I was in Bellevue ICU for 10 days. Dr. David Chiu was the micro-surgeon, plastic surgeon, who saved my finger. They were going to cut it off. It's crazy. So right now this was the second surgery, this is my last one, but they put a tendon in there from my wrist and they put membrane from my rib cage and they injected fat into the side of the finger so it looks straighter, which they took from the bottom of my hand. On whether his time in the hospital made him think about the show differently  The best thing about my show is that I know that there's people who are going through a tough time and hurting, and I get notes from them and I get social media from them. And I know there's people in the ICU, and there's people in the hospital that can't even send notes, but trust me, I'm sending them the best vibes. And I want them to laugh and get through whatever they're going through and get out of there, go home, get out of that hospital, get well. ... I'm meant to make people happy. That's my job. That's what I'm supposed to do on this earth. And I'm going to do whatever I can to make people happy. Sam Briger and Thea Chaloner produced and edited the audio of this interview.

npr,"October 12, 2017","As Democrats Purge Weinstein's Cash, Impact On The Party Is Likely To Be Low"," Updated at 3:20 p.m. ET As Democratic pols jettison their old contributions from Harvey Weinstein, the former entertainment executive embroiled in multiple allegations of sexual harassment and sexual misconduct, his cash is not likely to leave a big hole in party coffers. Weinstein was a dedicated Democratic donor as early as 1991, when he sent $500 to Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont. Overall, Weinstein and his former wife and current wife have given just over $1 million, according to Federal Election Commission records processed by Political MoneyLine. About $850,000 is from Weinstein himself. He also bundled, helping to raise an unknown amount of other people's money donated to Democratic presidential candidates. By comparison, the Center for Responsive Politics says San Francisco billionaire Tom Steyer gave Democrats and liberal groups $91 million just in the 2015-16 election cycle. Despite his frequent checks to candidates and party committees, which raise their money under tight contribution limits, Weinstein never ventured into the deep end of political giving, where America's wealthiest political players write seven- or eight-figure checks to largely unregulated super PACs. And his companies, Miramax and the Weinstein Company, don't appear in federal disclosure reports. His personal giving was outweighed by two other factors. He was a leader in a famously liberal industry. And as a bundler, he delivered much more in other people's money than he gave on his own. It all led to close connections with top-tier Democrats. When President Barack Obama visited Weinstein's home in 2012 for a fundraiser, Weinstein told the $35,800-per-ticket crowd, ""You can make the case that he's the Paul Newman of American presidents."" The New York Times once described Weinstein as ""a family friend"" of Bill and Hillary Clinton. And when host Charlie Rose interviewed him on CBS This Morning in 2012, they had this exchange. Rose: ""So Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, which of those three is your favorite?"" Weinstein: ""I have no favorites. It's like the Beatles."" This week, Barack and Michelle Obama, whose eldest daughter recently interned for the Weinstein Company, issued a statement saying they ""have been disgusted"" by the accounts of Weinstein's actions, while Hillary Clinton told CNN that his conduct ""was just intolerable in every way."" Much of Weinstein's cash went to either the Democratic National Committee or the party's House and Senate campaign committees. But the longest list of beneficiaries — now the longest list of politicians purging his contributions — is on the Senate side of the Capitol. Over the years, he gave to 30 Senate hopefuls — including Weinstein's sole Republican recipient, 2010 Senate candidate John Chachas in Nevada. Thirteen Weinstein recipients are now sitting senators, and 12 have said they're getting rid of his money. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., who got a total of $1,375 from Weinstein, said that she's contributing $10,000 to a women's shelter in Los Angeles. And Hillary Clinton has said she intends to donate Weinstein's past contributions to charity. Mike Fraioli, a veteran Democratic fundraiser, said Weinstein's exit from Democratic politics won't matter. ""There may have been a time when one individual was make or break,"" Fraioli said, but it's gone. ""There's just so much money in the system now.""

In 2009, the grizzled, once-washed-up comedian launched a podcast called WTF, and it became wildly popular — many people say Maron has defined what an interview podcast can be. He tapes most of his conversations in his cramped garage, where, in a bit of a role reversal, NPR interviewed him. ""I generally don't have a page full of questions, like you have there,"" Maron says. ""... I mean, I don't judge that, but, like, there are some interviews where I should have had that."" Maron has a new book out called Waiting for the Punch: Words to Live by from the WTF Podcast. On interviewing President Obama I'm having an experience here where my house is filled with Secret Service and police officers; we have five or six listening stations out on the deck for his staff. And in the house it's just me and Brendan McDonald, my producer, beforehand and I'm playing some guitar, trying to, you know, get into my body, wondering what I should wear. That was the first indication, was like, ""What should I wear? The president's coming."" And, like, it's my house — what am I going to wear? Am I gonna wear a suit? In my house? Because the president's coming? So I put on a plaid shirt and it just was fortunate that he's very disarming, he's very charming, he's very grounded. So, you know, he came in here and he put me at ease. ... You know, I was calling him ""man"" pretty quickly. I was finishing his sentences. On why he often asks guests what their parents do It's a very defining thing. That's what you lived in. You know, if you lived with your dad and he did a thing, that's going to define you somehow. You can't get out from under that. ... My dad was a surgeon and my mother was — she tried to get her master's in painting and then she did some splatter art on sweat suits to try to create a business. And she got a real estate license; she had a boutique. But my dad, for the most part, was a functioning orthopedic surgeon until, you know, his mental disposition shifted and somehow or another he, you know, he's out of the game. ... He had some depression issues and then he mismanaged his life in a lot of ways, but he's OK. He's in Albuquerque, [N.M.,] sitting around, you know, wondering what the point of life is and why he's so miserable. ... I kind of look at them as people I grew up with, you know, not parents. Words to Live by from the WTF Podcast by Marc Maron, John Oliver and Brendan McDonald Hardcover, 401 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? On how hanging out at his grandfather's store helped him become a good listener I was sort of on my own in the ""defining self"" department, which is why I always sort of gravitated toward screwed-up people to determine, you know, how I would live my life or behave. ... My grandfather had a hardware store in Haskell, N.J., you know, when I was a little kid. And there used to be this crew of three or four old dudes and I was just sort of fascinated with it. You're just sitting there talking to these guys. I go talk to the guy at the bookstore, go talk to the guy at the record store, go talk to the guy at the guitar store, and just spend my life wandering around hanging out at places, having conversations to avoid myself and also to get some guidance. I still do it — I don't know what records to buy. So, over time, I just became a good listener and I'd get emotionally attached to people very quickly. On interviewing Robin Williams about suicide four years before Williams hanged himself If you really thought about Robin Williams and really thought about that need to be that entertaining all the time — I would assume that, if you really think about it, that's not coming from a place of joy. He has to do it. He's got to do this thing to avoid something. No, but I don't think anyone could have thought that we would lose him. And it turns out there was other circumstances around that. That wasn't just depression; that was, you know, he was suffering from a degenerative illness. On whether good comedy often comes from a dark place I used to think that. I used to romanticize that. But after talking to almost 900 funny people, some of them are relatively well-adjusted. They seem responsible and grounded and well-boundaried — had at least one good parent.

npr,"October 9, 2017",Q-Tip Says His New Kennedy Center Role Helps 'Institutionalize Hip-Hop'," One of the most influential figures in hip-hop will now take a lead role in one of the nation's most prestigious cultural institutions. Q-Tip, along with Phife Dawg, Ali Shaheed Muhammad and Jarobi White, formed A Tribe Called Quest in the early '90s. The hip-hop collective introduced smooth beats and sharp social commentary inspired by the group's friendship and the issues of the time. Last year, the group released what would turn out to be its final album, We Got It from Here ... Thank You 4 Your Service, after the death of Phife Dawg. But now Q-Tip, the group's unofficial frontman, has a new role as the first artistic director for hip-hop culture at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C. Q-Tip tells NPR's Michel Martin that the new position will help ""institutionalize hip-hop."" On remembering Phife Dawg It's been difficult, but it's good because we are here and it's been a lot of growth through adversity. Once we realize you can get past it, it shapes and builds your character. And that's something that is more than a silver lining, it's a blessing. So although we have our emotional bouts with it as humans, it's been of value, of good value. On his new role at the Kennedy Center  I think it's a great opportunity for this country in a lot of different ways. A historic institution for arts such as the Kennedy Center that they would want to, in so many words, institutionalize hip-hop because for so long the creators and the practitioners of the form were looked at as degenerates, uneducated hoodlums, you know saying provocateurs, cop killers, rapers, like all these different labels. So through all the black and blues, to able to have the Kennedy Center wrap up hip-hop and claim it, like jazz before it and blues before it and so forth as a part of a true American art form to kind of investigate, not only the rich foundation of hip-hop and its beginnings, but it helps people who may not be from this world to understand truly the complexity — what black complexity is. It would be great to see the Mormon family from Utah running into a family from Harlem, African-American family, and they both are looking at something or sharing something about hip-hop whether it be like a Tupac display or a Grandmaster Flash DJ mix, and they see that they have something in common. The church of the arts, it's a great idea. On the current political climate One could really say given the climate that the lines have been clearly drawn, and there are sides now, like clear sides. People are saying well I'm here, rocking with the white supremacists, wall-building, pussy-grabbing, name-calling, that's my squad, who's your squad? There's a clear line drawn so some people may just be beyond it. I mean look, we are talking about our president, we got to talk about the elephant in the room, he's so polarizing that he and his wife had to kind of decline the invitation to the center, which is something since its inception, I believe since '73 or '74, that every sitting president happily went to because the arts is, it's our biggest export in this country. It's not oil, it's not apples, it's not cotton, it's entertainment in all forms — media, sports, music. So when you have something as prestigious as the Kennedy Center that's on your same lot and you're that polarizing that you would have to excuse yourself from that — it's real query.

npr,"October 8, 2017",Agnes Varda And JR: The Cinematic Odd Couple Behind 'Faces Places'," Agnes Varda is credited with making the very first French New Wave film in 1954. Later this year, she'll receive an honorary Oscar for Lifetime Achievement. And she's still making movies — her latest is called Faces Places, opening this week in U.S. theaters — and it's a collaboration with a street artist who goes by the initials JR. (He's the guy who created the giant toddler looking over the border wall between the U.S. and Mexico.) They're an odd cinematic couple — she's 89 years old. He's 34. She's a giant of film who stood alongside Godard and Truffaut in the 1950s and 60s. He's an up-and-coming visual artist who pastes giant figures on the sides of buildings. I'm always excited to paste and go in the action, and she made me realize that in cinema, in the writing of cinema, the reflection is the key of everything. JR ""Are we so different?"" JR asks. ""I mean, at the beginning it was a little bit harder for me because she would just direct everything and I couldn't place one word, and at some point I had to be like, 'OK, if we're really co-directing, I have to fight,'"" he laughs. ""We made a good team, you know,"" Varda says. ""We loved working together. We enjoyed it very much."" But JR admits that they work very differently. ""I'm from generation where everything goes super fast, where you film, write, text at the same time. And she's from a generation where you stop, think, think again and then do. I'm always excited to paste and go in the action, and she made me realize that in cinema, in the writing of cinema, the reflection is the key of everything."" Two years ago, JR and Varda set out to make some kind of project together; they didn't know what. Varda says they decided to visit villages in rural France and see what might happen. ""We thought that we could meet people and listen to them and listen enough that we would put them in the light, in a way ... give them value by noticing and listening to what they have to say."" They'd film their conversations, and JR created huge photographs that he and his team pasted onto the sides of buildings, barns, factory walls, giving their subjects larger-than-life identities. ""We chose normal people that we met, I would say, people with no power,"" Varda says. ""That was the point. The thing was, can we be person-to-person, and can we put the meeting as the main action? Meeting, listening, enjoying to meet."" They met striking dockworkers, farmers, a bell ringer. But as they travelled in his van — with the image of a camera pasted on each side — JR says the film also became about them. ""The mystery of our relation and where it's going. Literally, when you're watching the film, we also don't know where it's going,"" he says, ""and that allowed amazing surprise that we couldn't even have written. And the incredible thing for me is that we really didn't knew each other before we started the film. So it's not like, I met her a couple of times and then two years later we say, 'OK, we should do something.' It's literally, we met on a Monday. On a Tuesday, we meet again briefly. And on a Wednesday, we start shooting."" JR and Varda each came up with ideas. JR convinced Varda to think of striking dock workers in the port of Le Havre as a community, a village. She led him to a mailman, to some goat farmers. Then JR got Varda to agree to address her failing vision. ""The friendly curiosity that JR put on me about the way I age, it became for him a sort of side subject,"" she says. ""She didn't want me to film any of that, that she's seeing less and less,"" JR says, ""But the moment I actually got her to accept is when I say, 'Okay, let me try and realize what you're actually seeing.'"" We calculated that we are 55 years difference of age. And it doesn't show in the film. In the work it doesn't show. Agnes Varda JR recreated an ophthalmologist's vision chart on the steps of the French National Library, with 50 people holding giant letters and moving them up and down to replicate Varda's macular degeneration. ""So the thing about ... the way you look at things — that's the base of our work,"" Varda says. ""The base of filmmaker, photographer work. And the fact that my view, my look, my eye ... are getting weak and having problems, the question about out of focus or focus is part of our work. So I agree that JR questioned that."" And she questioned him. This is the first time in a career that spans more than 60 years that Varda has ever co-directed a film. And she says she found the perfect accomplice. ""We calculated that we are 55 years difference of age. And it doesn't show in the film. In the work it doesn't show. It shows on our faces. But the way we got along, the way we decided together — the project kept us very near to each other."" So far, Varda and JR have no plans to collaborate again — but she also has no plans to stop working.

npr,"October 6, 2017",Kenan Thompson Becomes Longest-Serving Cast Member On SNL," And I'm resisting the urge to give you a primal scream. We will instead talk about comedian Kenan Thompson, who has achieved a milestone. He is now the longest-serving cast member of ""Saturday Night Live"" in the 43-season history of that show. NPR's Eric Deggans met Thompson backstage. ERIC DEGGANS, BYLINE: Hours before Kenan Thompson will rehearse a sketch with guest host Ryan Gosling, he gets a little touch-up on his haircut inside his closet-sized dressing room at ""Saturday Night Live's"" studio in 30 Rockefeller Center. It's the Thursday before ""SNL's"" season premiere last week. The show returned from summer break after its most successful season in decades and a big win at the Emmy Awards for best variety sketch show. Humble and soft-spoken, Thompson seemed surprisingly relaxed. He said the show's success last season came from providing great satire of the Trump administration just when America needed to see it. KENAN THOMPSON: It was just that everybody was on the same page. That's what it was. You know what I'm saying? Like, when everybody's on the same page, everybody can hear the joke coming, and they can enjoy it. We're healing, like, a lot of wounds that people have to live with throughout their day. And they finally get to a Saturday night, and they can patch it up a little bit and go back to Monday. DEGGANS: The week is also significant for Thompson, who edges out impressionist Darrell Hammond as the show's longest-serving cast member. According to the fan website SNL Archives, Thompson's also performed the most impressions on the show at 126. Some highlights include retired Boston Red Sox star David Big Papi Ortiz... (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE"") THOMPSON: (As David Ortiz) Do you like basketball and football but they too fun and fast? (LAUGHTER) THOMPSON: (As David Ortiz) Try baseball. DEGGANS: ...""Family Feud"" host Steve Harvey... (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE"") THOMPSON: (As Steve Harvey) Welcome to ""Celebrity Family Feud."" Y'all like this suit? It's the first suit made by Hennessy. DEGGANS: ...And civil rights leader/MSNBC anchor Al Sharpton. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE"") THOMPSON: (As Al Sharpton) This Eric Garner decision has upset me so much that in three days, I have gained over 100 pounds. (LAUGHTER) DEGGANS: All this leads to a natural question - how has he stayed so funny on ""SNL"" for so long? THOMPSON: Man, I wish I could say, man. Like, it was a blessing just to get the job, you know I mean? Like, everything is so up in the air week by week, year by year in a place like this. DEGGANS: Bryan Tucker, the co-head writer for ""SNL"" and a longtime collaborator of Thompson's, offers a few ideas. BRYAN TUCKER: I think the biggest thing it takes is to have your own distinct voice that other people don't do. And then a willingness to do what we call, like, playing service. You know, stepping aside and letting someone else be the star. And when you come in in your three or four lines, you make them count. DEGGANS: Finding that distinct voice is an important moment for an ""SNL"" cast member, that moment they click with the material, the audience and the times. And that moment came for Thompson in 2009 thanks to the sketch called ""What's Up With That."" (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE"") WILL FORTE: (As announcer) It's ""What's Up With That,"" tackling the issues of today with soul. DEGGANS: The sketch itself is a fake talk show where three completely random guests wait for Thompson as host Deondre Cole to finish singing the theme song. But the joke is he never really stops. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE"") THOMPSON: (As Deondre Cole, singing) I woke up this morning and I got out of bed, had a big old cup of coffee... DEGGANS: After years of searching for a breakout bit, the sketch was a triumph for Thompson. And his co-workers knew it. TUCKER: He finished. The audience clapped. And then a bunch of ""SNL"" staff kind of applauded and gave him a high-five. You know, it's pretty rare I see that at ""SNL,"" that everybody just decides, you know, we're going to acknowledge this for one person. And it was kind of a celebration of Kenan. DEGGANS: Since then, Thompson has become one of the best sketch comedy actors on TV. He consistently knows how to score a laugh often just by making a face. The Atlanta native learned his comedy chops as a teen in local theater and then on Nickelodeon, where he starred on the mid-'90s sketch comedy show ""All That"" and then co-led a little sitcom called ""Kenan And Kel."" (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""AW, HERE IT GOES"") COOLIO: (Rapping) Everybody out there go run and tell your homeboys and home girls it's time for Kenan and Kel. THOMPSON: I was always very, like, professional in the approach to this, you know what I'm saying? And so it was never about what this could bring me. It was always just about, like, servicing whatever product I was doing. DEGGANS: Thompson's had roles in films like ""Fat Albert"" and ""The Smurfs."" And at age 39 he's gone from joining ""SNL"" as the youngest cast member in 2003 to being the second-oldest this fall, encouraging his cast mates and guest hosts with the knowledge that he's gained from years on the stage. ""SNL's"" co-head writer Tucker remains surprised Thompson hasn't broken out into bigger stardom like former cast mates Tina Fey, Fred Armisen and Kristen Wiig. TUCKER: Frankly, I often get a little frustrated that he hasn't broken out because I think he has this thing where you just like him no matter what he does. And I feel like that could translate to lots of other things. DEGGANS: But Thompson evokes uber-producers like Brian Grazer when asked what he'd like to do next. A devoted husband and father, he's less concerned with superstardom than steady, quality work, perhaps another reason he's lasted longer than anyone else in one of the toughest jobs in show business.

The Times report also says Weinstein settled complaints with at least eight women. Weinstein is one of the most powerful men in Hollywood. He co-founded Miramax, which has produced such Academy Award-winning films as Pulp Fiction, Chicago, The English Patient and Shakespeare in Love. He and his brother, Bob, head The Weinstein Co. Along with movies, the Weinsteins have produced a number of Tony Award-winning shows on Broadway. Harvey Weinstein is also known for his temper and, the Times story says, his inappropriate behavior toward women has been discussed within his companies for years. The story begins with actress Ashley Judd being invited to what she thought was a business breakfast with Weinstein at the Peninsula Hotel in Los Angeles. Instead, she says, she was sent to his room where he asked her to give him a massage or watch him shower. ""How do I get out of the room as fast as possible without alienating Harvey Weinstein?"" Judd is quoted as saying in the article. Weinstein released a statement in response to the allegations. He apologizes for some of his behavior by saying that times have changed since he began in the movie business: ""I came of age in the 60's and 70's, when all the rules about behavior and workplaces were different. That was the culture then. I have since learned it's not an excuse, in the office — or out of it. To anyone. I realized some time ago that I needed to be a better person and my interactions with the people I work with have changed. I appreciate the way I've behaved with colleagues in the past has caused a lot of pain, and I sincerely apologize for it."" At the same time, one of Weinstein's lawyers, Lisa Bloom, released a statement saying ""he denies many of the accusations as patently false."" Weinstein says he will take time to ""conquer his demons."" He also says he will use the time to fight the National Rifle Association. Weinstein is a longtime donor to Democratic candidates and liberal causes.

""I have no idea who Eminescu is, but I've seen that come up three times in episodes across the decades,"" he says. Asked by Trebek how he got to be so smart, Rogers replies drolly: ""Genetics. Luck.

npr,"October 5, 2017",'The Apprentice' Creators Look Back," Donald Trump's reality TV show ""The Apprentice"" first aired in 2004. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""THE APPRENTICE"") PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: My name's Donald Trump, and I'm the largest real estate developer in New York. SIEGEL: He left the show last year during his presidential campaign. And though Trump has exaggerated the ratings for ""The Apprentice,"" it was a hit, especially in its first season. For her podcast Embedded, our co-host Kelly McEvers introduces us to a few people who had a lot to do with the show's initial success. Whether they feel good about it is another thing. KELLY MCEVERS, BYLINE: The first sense that ""The Apprentice"" was going to be a big hit was back in 2003 at the first casting call in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York. Rob LaPlante was the casting director. ROB LAPLANTE: The first thing that I noticed that morning which blew my mind was the line wrapped around Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue and then all the way down 56th Street for blocks. There were a thousand people in line to try out for a show that no one had ever even known or heard of to this point. And that was my first introduction to the fact that this guy, Donald Trump, is something more than just a celebrity and a businessman. He has got a bit of a cult following. MCEVERS: LaPlante was like, wow, maybe this show's going to do really well, and we're all going to make a lot of money... (SOUNDBITE OF THE O'JAYS SONG, ""FOR THE LOVE OF MONEY"") MCEVERS: ...Because those contestants - LaPlante says they were stand-ins for all of us. If they wanted to be Donald Trump, that means tons of people watching wanted to be him, too. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""FOR THE LOVE OF MONEY"") THE O'JAYS: (Singing) Money, money, money, money... MCEVERS: And you can see this on the show. This song plays at the beginning of each episode. And the contestants have to go out and do things like sell lemonade on Wall Street. And then the team that sells the most gets to do stuff like go see Donald Trump's apartment. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""THE APPRENTICE"") UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Words can't describe how beautiful it was. Everything you saw was breathtaking. And we got to meet his girlfriend, Melania, who is amazing as well. Hi. MELANIA TRUMP: Hi. I'm Melania. MCEVERS: In other words, to win meant to live Donald Trump's life if even for just a little while. Troy McClain was one of those people who was a stand-in for the viewers. Troy grew up in Idaho and Montana, and he had a pretty tough childhood. But then he read Donald Trump's book ""The Art Of The Deal."" His senior quote in his yearbook was Donald Trump, I'm coming. Fourteen years later, he sees an ad on TV to try out for ""The Apprentice."" He makes an audition tape. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TROY MCCLAIN: I develop real estate property just like you, Donald. Let me show you... MCEVERS: And he gets on the show where they play up the whole country kid comes to the city thing. At one point, he pitches a celebrity auction to Russell Simmons of Def Jam records, and Simmons is surprised when he first hears Troy. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""THE APPRENTICE"") RUSSELL SIMMONS: You're not self-conscious about your accent, are you? MCCLAIN: You can make fun of me with my accent (laughter). That's all right. MCEVERS: Getting made fun of for where he's from is something that really bothers Troy. And this has a lot to do with how he felt about Donald Trump back then and how he feels about him now. MCCLAIN: We always felt like the social elite, even though we didn't know who they were - the social elite was holding us down. MCEVERS: But Troy didn't see Donald Trump as the social elite. He saw him as an outsider who made it in. MCCLAIN: He had the arrogance and the cockiness, and he also had that stick-it-to-the-man attitude. MCEVERS: This is stuff we heard a lot during the election and after. But Troy was thinking this way for a long time. And if Troy was thinking this way, so were lots of people who were watching him on ""The Apprentice."" MCCLAIN: I bet those 20 million Americans a week that were watching it - the majority of them weren't the Ivy Leagues or the Harvard grads or the politicians. They were the ones that were looking to see if somebody like myself can make it. MCEVERS: By the time of the finale, 28 million people watched ""The Apprentice."" And the next year after that first season, Donald Trump had his highest Gallup poll approval ratings ever. So if the contestants were a way for all of us to get closer to Donald Trump, the producers were the way to shape who Donald Trump appeared to be on the show. One of the main producers on ""The Apprentice"" was a guy named Bill Pruitt, and he says it was fun making the show mainly because Donald Trump was a natural talent, like the second time he fired someone. BILL PRUITT: And Trump threw in what we called the cobra, where he threw out his fingers, thrust them at the guy. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""THE APPRENTICE"") D. TRUMP: Jason, Jason, this is a tough one. You're fired. PRUITT: And I remember, in the control room, watching, it was visceral. It was like he shot him. Everyone in the room went, oh, whoa, wow, whoa. So the cobra became sort of a trademark move that he did beyond you're fired. MCEVERS: But then Bill Pruitt says Donald Trump started saying inappropriate things on the set. You might remember; Bill Pruitt is the guy who tweeted about all this right after the release of the ""Access Hollywood"" tape last October of Trump saying grab women by the you-know. Pruitt tweeted, I assure you, when it comes to the hashtag #TrumpTapes, there are far worse. And now is the first time Bill Pruitt has talked about what's on those tapes, though he can't go into too much detail. He did sign a non-disclosure agreement. He says it happened when Trump and the producers would talk about who to fire. Was it just about women... PRUITT: No. MCEVERS: ...Mostly about women. PRUITT: Very much a racist issue. MCEVERS: It was about race... PRUITT: Yeah. MCEVERS: ...About African-Americans, Jewish people, all of the above. PRUITT: Yep. When you heard these things, there's the audible gasp that is quickly followed by a cough, kind of like (gasping), you know, and then (coughing) - yes, anyway, you know? And then you just sort of carry on. MCEVERS: Is there ever a time when you think, I wish I would have told him not to say things like that? PRUITT: That's a really good question. It was not my place to be, hey, TV star, you know, reason we're all here, shut your [expletive] damn mouth, and don't ever, ever repeat what you just said. Of course, you know, you think that. You go back to your hotel room or your apartment that they put you up in. And you know, you do some soul-searching. MCEVERS: But he did not say anything. We should say we reached out to the White House, and an official called Bill's story, quote, ""the same recycled and false attacks."" Bill Pruitt says he also feels bad about the fact that the story they were telling on ""The Apprentice,"" this thing about Trump as this successful billionaire, wasn't exactly true. Bill Pruitt says he saw that up close at Trump's Taj Mahal casino. PRUITT: You walk in there, and you see, you know, neons falling. It was the Ta Mahal (ph) or something, you know? There was no J 'cause the neons were out, you know? (Laughter) They just hadn't had the opportunity to replace it yet. It wasn't a priority 'cause the carpets were already rotting. And it just stinked to high heaven. MCEVERS: But that's not the way you made it look... PRUITT: Not at all. MCEVERS: ...In that opening sequence. PRUITT: Exactly. I mean everything we said about him was truthful. It's what we didn't say about him. Do you know what I mean? It was a convenient vacation of the truth. MCEVERS: At the time of ""The Apprentice,"" Donald Trump's companies had already been through four bankruptcies, and there were two more to come, including the Taj Mahal. Airbrushing all this out is what Bill Pruitt says he feels most guilty about now. He says he was a good con artist, and his con helped take Donald Trump all the way to the White House. PRUITT: We told a story. We went with beginnings and middles and ends and villains and protagonists, and we went about the business of putting music and picture and sound together. And now all of a sudden we're here. A cultural icon emerged because we weren't necessarily truthful about our portrayal. MCEVERS: Bill Pruitt only worked on ""The Apprentice"" for two seasons, but he kept working in reality TV. He put two kids through college that way. Now he works on documentaries. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""PUT YOUR MONEY WHERE YOUR MOUTH IS"") D. TRUMP: Donald Trump. UNIDENTIFIED SINGER: (Singing) Money. SIEGEL: That's Kelly McEvers. And this is music from the DVD box set of ""The Apprentice."" (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""PUT YOUR MONEY WHERE YOUR MOUTH IS"") D. TRUMP: Move faster. Work harder. Move faster, harder. Be paranoid. Stay focused. Don't blow it. Copyright © 2017 NPR.  All rights reserved.  Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

npr,"October 26, 2017",How 5 Tech Giants Have Become More Like Governments Than Companies," This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. It's difficult to get jazzed about smartphones and social networks when they might be ruining the world. That's what my guest, Farhad Manjoo, writes. And he's been covering tech for 20 years. For the last three, he's written the New York Times column ""State Of The Art"" in which he explores how the latest tech ideas are shaping the future. Now he's writing a series about the Frightful Five. That's his name for tech giants Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook and Microsoft, which make up half of the top 10 most valuable companies on the American stock market and which Manjoo says collectively influence just about everything else that happens in tech, as well as the rest of the global economy. He's also writing a book about the five. Farhad Manjoo, welcome to FRESH AIR. What makes the Frightful Five frightful? What did they have to do to get on your list? FARHAD MANJOO: So what makes them frightful, first of all, is that they are very, very big. And they play a huge role - they all play sort of huge roles in our lives kind of personally and at a kind of society-wide level. So if you live kind of a modern American life, it's impossible to, you know, to live without all of them for most people. And more than that, they sort of are being asked to do and they kind of know more about us than any corporations in history. They're more - they've become kind of more like governments than companies with the amount of money they have, with the kind of power they have over democracy in society. We're seeing that with the way that, you know, news on Facebook and Google affected the election, with their impact on the economy, you know, the way they're disrupting kind of how retail works, with their impact on jobs and inequality. And eventually, you know, they're all working on artificial intelligence. And their technologies will affect probably most of our jobs. Most of the ways that people make money now are going to be changed by technologies that these companies make. GROSS: Yeah. And when you say that they're like governments, they're sometimes more like governments than corporations, you point out that they're doing things that government - that our government used to do in terms of innovation. What are some examples that you're thinking of? MANJOO: Yeah. So, you know, many of the technologies that we use today at kind of their earliest levels were started by grants for the Defense Department or just kind of basic science research. Now a lot of that is being done by these companies. Artificial intelligence is kind of the primary example. These companies are going to be building the future of transportation in the United States, in the world. You know, they're building self-driving cars. They're building drones. They're building kind of the infrastructure of the United States - the infrastructure of the next 20, 30, 40 years in ways that we used to look to kind of governments to do. You know, Amazon has a fleet of planes, drones. It is in the kind of shipping business. It affects stores around you. Much of the kind of physical world around you is being shaped by, you know, that one company. And you can point to kind of similar ways that all the other companies are shaping the world around you in ways that are sort of huge economically and socially and that are kind of unavoidable. Like essentially - in one of my pieces, I wrote that they kind of blanket the entire society in their technology, and you can't really escape them. GROSS: When we talk about Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook and Microsoft, we're also talking about companies that most people don't know are owned by these five mega tech companies. So what are some examples of things that we might not associate with Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook and Microsoft but really are part of them? MANJOO: Right. So Facebook, for example, also owns Instagram - one of the most popular social networks in the world. It owns WhatsApp, which is I think the most popular messaging app other than a couple that are in China. And, you know, it owns Facebook, which reaches 2 billion people a month. Google, in addition to kind of the Google search engine, it has a whole suite of mapping technologies. So there's Google Maps, but there's also Waze, another popular app for getting around. Google owns YouTube. Amazon, in addition to Amazon the store, it owns many different kind of media and publishing properties, so Audible, which has audio books. Amazon also owns Zappos the shoe company. It sort of owns this suite of different e-commerce sites. And Amazon is sort of doing more than shopping now. One of its huge ventures is artificial intelligence. And you can personify it through their device called the Amazon Echo, which you put in your house and you talk to. It's your assistant. So, you know, these are examples of companies and products that are part of the five. And they really exemplify the way the five are going into - you know, they're really stretched far horizontally. Kind of every product or service that you might want to use, you're going to touch one of these companies. I think Google is the most - is the perfect example of this. So what Google did a couple years ago is they switched from being Google, Google incorporated to Alphabet. So Alphabet is a holding company, many people may not have heard of it. Every time I write about Alphabet I have to very - I have to specify that we're actually talking about Google. But what Alphabet is is it's a holding company that has Google. Google is its sort of biggest property, but then it has a whole bunch of other companies you may not have heard of. One of them is like their research lab called Google X, another is something called Google Brain, which is a company that is looking at ways to have artificial intelligence do things like medical diagnosis. There is a self-driving car company called Waymo. There's another health company called Verily. There's sort of a suite of companies that are under this alphabet umbrella related to Google. So they get all their money from Google but, you know, in the future, the plan is that Google as an entity will be just one of many different companies owned by this larger company that will, you know, affect everything that we do. GROSS: So like the origin stories for like Google, Facebook and Apple, they're all about like a guy or a couple of guys in a garage or dorm room dreaming up these great ideas that lead to something remarkably innovative. But now you're saying now that these companies that they dreamed of are so big, they're actually in some ways suppressing innovation - the innovations of other, you know, men and women in their dorm rooms or garages dreaming up ideas. So in what ways do you think that these companies now sometimes suppress innovation? MANJOO: This, I think, is the huge change in how the tech industry works now versus how it worked back when some of these companies were starting up. It's still possible to come out to Silicon Valley and start, you know, some new app, some - create some new piece of hardware that lots of people like and that takes the world by storm. But there's now kind of a ceiling on how successful your idea can be, and the ceiling is kind of determined by these five companies. So one of the things that these five companies have done kind of masterfully is create these platforms that startups have to use to get to customers. So they all own these cloud-storage services. So Amazon is an example. If you want to store your media online - so, for example, all the movies that you watch on Netflix are actually stored on Amazon servers - so every time you use Netflix, Netflix is kind of paying Amazon for that kind of storage. GROSS: I have to tell you, I was really surprised when I read that. I didn't know that. MANJOO: Yeah. It's surprising, first of all, because they're such different companies. You wouldn't really know - you wouldn't really think that they would have that kind of connection. And then they're also competitors. Netflix makes original TV shows and so does Amazon. And so, you know, in this way, Netflix has this dependence on one of its competitors. There are lots of different examples of this though. There - you know, all app makers have to put their apps in the Apple app store or the Google app store. And when they sell in those apps, 30 percent of that money goes to Apple or Google. They all have to advertise on Facebook or Google to get customers because that's become the way to advertise on digital platforms. And so any new app - Uber, Airbnb, Netflix, all the other sort of smaller companies online - have to go through these five to get to their customers. And what ends up happening is that other companies succeed, but always these five benefit off of that success. GROSS: So what's an example of how one of these big companies dealt with a new startup or a new innovation that might've been competitive or appealing? MANJOO: Yeah. The best example we've seen recently is sort of what's happened to Snapchat. So Snapchat is a very popular and really innovative idea. So Snapchat is an app where primarily teenagers, young people, send messages that disappear. So they don't last forever. You send a picture and kind of a caption to your friend. They see it for a little while, and it disappears. And the other thing you do on this app is you make something called a story, which is like a slideshow of your day. And after a day, your friends see it and then it goes away. And these were very popular. And Facebook, which is obviously the leader in social networking, they noticed the popularity of Snap, and several times they tried to buy the company. Facebook offered Snap $3 billion, and Snap turned them down. And then earlier this year Snap went public on the stock market, and it was sort of this huge event for them. You know, this is the next step in kind of the evolution of their company. And right after that, Facebook copied Stories, this format that's very popular on Snapchat. It copied it to essentially all of Facebook's platforms, and basically overnight the version of Stories in Instagram, in Facebook's company, became far more popular than Stories in Snapchat. And ever since then Snapchat's stock has suffered, and analysts and other people I talked to have a much kind of dimmer view of the future of that company than they did before because Facebook is gunning for them, and it's just really hard to see how they can kind of get out from under that competition. GROSS: So you see that as an example of how one of the big companies can suppress or co-opt the innovation of a startup? MANJOO: Yeah. It's the role of startups in the modern tech economy is to provide, you know, ideas for the big companies to kind of run with and make money from. And the other thing that the startups do is they pay a lot of money for the goods and services that the big companies provide. So half of Snapchat's revenues actually go to Google because Google hosts the actual content on Snapchat. So in this weird way, you know, Snapchat is paying half of its revenues to Google, one of the five. It's being copied left and right by another of the five, Facebook. And it's trying to make money in the Internet ad economy, and the biggest players in the Internet ad economy are Google and Facebook. So it's also competing with them for advertisers. It's a really unenviable position to be in. GROSS: Well, let's take a break here, and then we'll talk some more about what my guest, Farhad Manjoo, calls the frightful five, which is Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook and Microsoft. He writes the tech column ""State Of The Art"" for The New York Times, and he's doing a series on this group that he calls the frightful five. We're going to be right back after a break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR, and if you're just joining us, my guest is Farhad Manjoo, who writes about tech for The New York Times. He writes the ""State Of The Art"" column, which explores how the latest tech ideas are shaping the future. And he's now writing a series about big tech companies, the ones he calls the frightful five - Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook and Microsoft. Now, you say the frightful five are so big, and yet they're not regulated by the government and they don't really fit into the standards that we measure monopolies by. Like, they don't conform to monopoly standards. So what's different about these tech companies from companies that we might consider a monopoly? MANJOO: So one of the differences is that they're new and they're growing in new markets. And in those markets, it's sort of - in some ways it's kind of too early to call them the winners, according to regulators. And other ways, they've sort of grown really quickly, but many people see sort of more room to grow. So it's, according to regulators and others who study these markets, kind of perhaps too soon to say that they've won. But for example, you know, Amazon has disrupted essentially all of the retail business, like, everyone from Walmart to, you know, every mom and pop shop has some fear and strategy for responding to the threat of Amazon. But if you look at kind of the size of Amazon and the scope of the entire retail business, it's not that big. It's not even half of all online sales, and it's something like 8 percent of all retail sales in the United States. So it's growing very quickly, and it has built this infrastructure for kind of the future of commerce. It's built all these warehouses and this very efficient way of shipping goods to people. And everyone who understands e-commerce understands that, like, the future of retail in America belongs to Amazon. But at this point, it's small. And so for regulators who worry about... GROSS: Wait. Small when measured against overall retail numbers and... MANJOO: Right. So yes. So at this point... GROSS: 'Cause there's nothing small about Amazon so (laughter)... MANJOO: (Laughter) You're right. GROSS: ...Sounds like a contradiction. MANJOO: Yeah. But at this point it's, you know, it's about a quarter of the size of Walmart. It's growing very quickly, growing faster than than Walmart is, but it's only a quarter of the size of Walmart. It just beat out last year sales of Costco, and it is a very small percentage of overall retail. So if you're a regulator worried about kind of monopolies, a monopoly threat, it's difficult to kind of look at traditional ways of measuring monopolies, like how much market concentration there is. Or another thing you'd worry about is, is this company big enough that it's able to kind of control prices? Well, Amazon is not that big. It's not sort of, you know, if you're worried about suppliers of goods being priced out, you really would worry about Walmart more. I mean, Walmart is sort of known for low prices and its demands on suppliers to constantly lower their prices. And so for regulators who are worried about the dominance of a single company on a sector, Amazon presents this real puzzle for them. In fact it's such a puzzle that progressives and people on the left who've studied antitrust say that we need a whole new slate of laws and regulations to contain Amazon and to regulate it than we do now. The fundamentally kind of antitrust laws that we have today don't work for Amazon. GROSS: So what kind of laws are they thinking about? MANJOO: So there was this - one of the interesting things I discovered in looking at these five companies is that there's been this sea change in America in how we think about dangerous kind of corporate dominance. And before the 1980s, we were essentially a lot more strict in the United States about corporate size. And you know, the government was a lot more interventionist in preventing mergers that may affect how a market works. And what happened in the 1980s is that, you know, a group of economists and lawyers known as the Chicago School and the Reagan administration kind of completely changed how we looked at corporate dominance in America, especially about sort of the danger, how we thought of the dangers of monopolies. And so the upshot of that is they looked mostly at price when determining whether a merger could go through, whether a company could get bigger. And they didn't look at sort of non-price effects like customer service or the effect on suppliers or the effect on the environment or adjacent industries. If you look at price only, you won't - you're not likely to kind of stop Amazon because one of the benefits that Amazon has had is that investors sort of have been betting on kind of constant growth from Amazon, and as a result they don't really expect Amazon to be very profitable. Amazon is sort of famously not profitable at all because it reinvests everything it makes into building out more warehouses and building, you know, to getting bigger for the next year. And so Amazon really doesn't have to raise prices. It constantly lowers prices. It has this effect on the rest of the of the retail business that results in lower prices. So if you were looking at prices alone, you would say this is a great company. It's great for customers that this company is kind of constantly lowering prices and forcing everyone else to lower prices. Under the kind of current view of antitrust, Amazon seems like a positive force rather than a negative force. But if you go back, according to, you know, the people who want us to rethink how we do antitrust, if you go back to kind of a pre-1980s view of this structure and this market, you would see that Amazon is sort of, you know, getting its kind of corporate tentacles into a large part of the economy, into shipping, and how warehouses work and robots. Things that will allow it to dominate in the future that we're kind of just not good at regulating at this point. GROSS: My guest is Farhad Manjoo, who writes The New York Times tech column ""State Of The Art,"" and he's writing a series about the tech giants he calls the frightful five - Apple, Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Facebook. After we take a short break, he'll talk about the dark side of Google and smartphones and why he set up cameras in his home that record everything his family does in the living room and dining room. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross back with Farhad Manjoo, who writes The New York Times tech column ""State Of The Art"" about how the latest tech ideas are shaping the future. He's now writing a series about the tech giants he calls the frightful five - Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook and Microsoft. The frightful five are also the subject of a book he's writing. He says there's an ongoing debate about whether they should be regulated, but they're hard to regulate because they're so different from the type of corporate giants that antitrust laws were designed for. So, you know, one of the things people are wondering, like, should this be regulated is, fake news. And, you know, Facebook and Twitter are responding to concerns about fake news and where are ads coming from. So Twitter has issued, like, new guidelines for what it's going to do. You want to run through - Twitter's not part of your frightful five, but it's still pretty big, and it's important in the context of what we're talking about. Do you want to just run through some of the things they plan on doing? MANJOO: Yeah. Both Twitter and Facebook sort of had these - posted these guidelines earlier, which is they plan to - they say they plan to show you who's running these ads, who's sort of - who's paying for the ads and to be more transparent about other ads that those people have posted. So If you - so one of the problems that we've seen is that, you know, these kind of shady groups that are not kind of identified - you don't know where the money is coming from. You don't know what their agenda is. You don't know what other advertisements they've run. They've been able to kind of place these ads all over Facebook and Twitter and kind of affect the news and, you know, protests and kind of just society in America under these guidelines that companies are rolling out voluntarily. But you know, there might be legislation to this effect. That will be less possible because you'll be able to - it's plausible you'll be able to kind of find out who's running these campaigns. GROSS: In terms of Facebook, aren't they considering, like, working with fact-checking partners and labeling stories that are disputed as fake news? MANJOO: Yeah. So one of the real difficulties about looking at these companies is that in some ways, regulating them, making them better gives them more power. So Facebook is now - so Facebook's news feed is sort of one of the most popular places for getting news in the world. It's you know - combined, more people read it than, you know, all the major newspapers in the country, the TV networks. It's extremely influential. And right now there's very little fact-checking that Facebook does, which is, you know, what led to this proliferation of fake news and these kind of echo chambers that people have. The solution to that could be that Facebook decides it's going to partner with fact-checking companies, and perhaps it might do fact-checking itself. And Facebook would sort of be in some way the arbiter for what's right and wrong on Facebook. That may help with the fake news problem. I think it's unclear at this point. But the kind of upshot of that is, on the other hand, you get Facebook kind of acting as something like the ministry of information for kind of every country in which it operates, where, you know, it might be able to decide, like, this is true, and this is not true. How it'll make those decisions and who it'll employ to make those decisions I think is a big question. And, like, suddenly it's going to have this power, and it's going to come about perhaps as a solution to another problem that it itself caused. GROSS: So throughout this interview, we've been hearing a lot of your, you know, kind of criticisms about these five companies. And we should say you're hardly a technophobe. And reading about how you have your house wired (laughter) - you've got, like, everything in your house. You've got, like, all the gadgets and all the new, like, Internet of things kind of things. So let's start with, like - you wrote a column about how you've basically made your home into a reality show because your living room and - is it dining room... MANJOO: Yeah. GROSS: ...Are wired with cameras that - kind of like a lot of public bathrooms, when you walk in in those bathrooms, the lights turn on. When you walk out, they turn off because they have, like, motion sensors. And that's how these cameras are wired. So describe for us the setup that you have with these cameras and why you're doing it. MANJOO: OK, so I'll describe the setup first. So they're - it's sort of in the public places of our house so, I mean, not the bedrooms - so the dining room, the living room, the kitchen. GROSS: And not the bathroom (laughter). MANJOO: Not the bathroom, yes. And there are a bunch of cameras. I think there are five now. And they kind of get all angles. And the reason I'm doing it is because I have two kids - young kids, 7 and 5 - almost 5. And you know, like everyone else who raises kids today, I take a lot of photos of them and a lot of videos, but I always feel like I'm missing stuff. They're extremely, like, cute. And I'm busy, and they say things, and I - and, like, I always worry that I'm just, like, missing their lives. So I got this idea because I saw some researchers had done this. Like, psychology researchers had a videotaped their own children to kind of look at their language development. And I thought, wouldn't that be super interesting to do that, to just have memories of my kids? It took a lot of lobbying of my wife, who is just not a tech person at all. And she, you know, was worried about the privacy implications and just, like, the idea of being surveilled in your house. Eventually I convinced her. I managed to kind of get her buy-in. We've been doing it for about a year now. And it'll be interesting, you know? It'll be really just, like, fascinating to me to watch those videos in the future and to show my kids those videos, you know, like, if my daughter who's now 5 is, like, 25 and to show her, like, what she looked like and what she said. And you know, I'd love to have memories of my own childhood from then. And I think they will appreciate that in the future. GROSS: OK. So part of what I'm hearing here is you saying, like, you're too busy to watch your kids grow up, so you retire, you'll be able to watch the TV version (laughter). MANJOO: Yeah. I mean, I'll cop to that. It's - that is a slightly cynical way to put it, but I don't think it's wrong. I mean, I think in many instances, we do now miss out on our children. I try not to. And you know, one of the things this helps me with is I don't have to pick up my phone to take videos of them. I can sort of just be in the moment. Like, we were - I was playing video games with my son last night, and he, like, said - you know, he was just, like, very - it was just very interesting and memorable for me to watch him, like, learn how to play this video game. And I would like to see that again (laughter) at some point. And so the idea of having that is - and it just feels like I'm capturing these memories that will one day be useful. GROSS: So have you been using those videos to settle arguments such as, no, I did tell you about this; you say I didn't, but I'm telling you I did, and now we will watch the tape and prove that I am right? MANJOO: It has been tempting. (LAUGHTER) MANJOO: I have wanted to do that. I've just resisted 'cause I don't - especially with my wife, like, I don't want to have the video sort of come between us. I have used it as, like, a disciplinary tool with my kids. So like, I've told my son, you know, like, not to start a fight with his sister. And then, like, I've sort of slyly mentioned I will be able to see if you did, you know, if they're alone in the room or something. And that's the kind of extent that I've used it - just kind of as a warning that I can look back at what's happening. GROSS: So my understanding is - right? - that the system that you have, the camera system - it records for a week, and then it deletes everything at the end of a week except for the things you've asked it to save. MANJOO: Yeah, that's how it works. It's like a surveillance camera at a convenience store, you know, it has a loop. GROSS: (Laughter) Just what everybody wants in their home. MANJOO: Exactly. It has a loop, a seven day, you know, storage of everything you take. So when something memorable happens, something I just want to capture, I write a note to myself of the time in my phone. And then once a week, I look at the videos. I go back to that time, and then I save those videos. GROSS: So what's a moment you're really glad you were able to preserve on video? MANJOO: It's the small things. So it's like we're having dinner and my daughter says something completely unexpected, like, makes a joke for the first time - like, this has happened - you know, says something that makes the whole rest of the family laugh. And she's 5. And so that's like - it happens once for the first time. And it like surprised her. And she got kind of embarrassed about it. And she didn't know that, like, making everyone laugh was like a good thing, was like something that people wanted to do. She thought that we were laughing at her. It was like a cute moment and a touching moment. And, you know, ordinarily, like, we'd just forget that. You just never have that moment. And now I have that. It's just like - dinners - really interesting things happen at dinner, I've realized after this. And just having those moments is going to be really fun in the future. GROSS: So your kids are 7 and 4 now. Do they understand that cameras are recording them? And if so, does it make them self-conscious? MANJOO: They do understand that cameras are recording them because I've shown them the videos. It hasn't made them self-conscious. What's actually happened is it's sort of done the opposite. It's made them performative. So my daughter will like - like if we play a song, she'll like go to the camera and sort of do a dance for the camera. And I think this is the influence of YouTube. They watch YouTube. And on YouTube, there's, you know, kids their age performing for cameras. Like, they have their own sort of YouTube shows. And because my kids watch YouTube and have these cameras that they know sort of are recording things that can be on YouTube, it seems like they act like - they try to act like YouTube stars, like people are watching them and they're trying to cultivate an audience. GROSS: Well, I think about how really different that was from like when I was growing up and the only people who were on video were people on TV. And there were only a few channels, so very few people were on TV. And it just seemed so, like, remarkable and impossible. And it's just amazing how like in a few decades how radically things can change. I know I'm stating the obvious, but it's no less remarkable even though it's obvious. MANJOO: Yeah. Yeah. No, I agree with that. I mean, I really wonder what my children's sort of conception of celebrity is going to be. They follow a YouTube star who's - it's weird even calling someone a YouTube star. He has - he's, you know, I think around 10 years old. And he has a following of, I think, a few million people on YouTube. And he just does kid stuff. Like he plays and he plays with toys and plays video games. And other kids watch him do this. We were on vacation in Hawaii, and we passed a kid that my kids swore was that kid, the sort of the YouTube star. And it was as if they had seen like, you know, the biggest celebrity. Like, they were shy. They were talking to each other about, like, whether that was him. They wanted to like go and search for him and get his autograph. It was like, you know, very cute and wondrous to see, but it was something I'd never heard of in like in my own definition would not sort of qualify as a celebrity, as someone worth meeting. But for them, he was like the biggest star of all time. GROSS: Also interesting. (Laughter) OK. If you're just joining us, my guest is Farhad Manjoo. And he writes the ""State Of The Art"" column at The New York Times, which explores how the latest tech ideas are shaping the future. He's now writing a series about the tech companies he calls the Frightful Five - Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook and Microsoft. He's also writing a book about these companies. We're going to take a short break and then be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF OF MONTREAL'S ""FABERGE FALLS FOR SHUGGIE"") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Farhad Manjoo, who writes the ""State Of The Art"" tech column for The New York Times and is now writing a series of articles about the tech companies he calls the Frightful Five - Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook and Microsoft. So throughout this interview, we've been hearing a lot of your, you know, kind of criticisms about these five companies. And you write, it's difficult to get jazzed about smartphones and social networks when they might be ruining the world (laughter) and that technologies that we were most excited about 10 years ago are now implicated in just about every catastrophe of the day. MANJOO: Yeah. It is difficult for me to get excited about technology anymore. Like, you know, I write a column about technology. And like, as a result of that, I get to try out basically everything there is. And it's sort of been my dream job because I like wanted to do that. I'm interested in the future, and I'm interested in sort of what's going to happen with all this new stuff. But my sort of default position about whether this stuff is going to be good or bad in the world has changed. So in the past, my kind of reflexive bias of a new piece of technology was - tended toward optimism. You know, I had the feeling that probably it's better than the stuff we have now, and because it's better than the stuff we have now, it's going to kind of make us more efficient or help us like connect with people. And that has to be good. And, you know, that's the way - that's sort of the default position of, I think, everyone in Silicon Valley. Like, people who run these companies have this idea that any new piece of technology is probably going to be good. And my own view has shifted on that. I think that we should all be more skeptical of the unseen and longer-term potential dangers of these technologies before we kind of rush to embrace them. And my default view is no longer sort of optimism. It's more - it's, like, skepticism and just a more balanced view of, like - like, this thing could be big. It could be important. But it could be important in positive ways and plausibly very negative ways and that we should consider sort of both of those things. GROSS: What's an example of something that you initially thought was really positive and you came to see the dark side of it? I'm sure there's many examples to choose from here (laughter). MANJOO: (Laughter) Yeah. I mean, a really kind of clear example is Google, the search engine. So it just sounds - it sounds obvious that providing the world information for free on demand is going to be good. Like, throughout human history, we have been better when we learn more, when we get more information, when we produce more, when we share more. That's sort of the story behind public libraries and, like, encyclopedias and just books and printing in general. And so you would imagine that having that be accessible to the whole world would just naturally be good. And there are many arguments that, you know - there's sort of a lot of benefit I think from having Google as a search engine and having all this information. But on the other hand, there's no doubt that Google has led to, you know - has fed the rise of conspiracy thinking in America. Like, anyone can produce some piece of content that questions some completely valid fact about the world. They can put together a lot of information that suggests there's another point of view. Like, there are people who believe that the Earth is flat. And they can make YouTube videos about it, and they can make web pages about it. And then a lot of people start talking about it, and that starts trending on Google. Like, you will search for 9/11 or, like, whether the Earth is flat or not, and you will find at the very, you know, in prominent locations on Google this other view of the world. And you can get sucked into that and you can start believing things that are completely not true as a result of this tool that was made to enlighten the world. So you know, that's, like, an example of, you know, something that people thought would be obviously good. And it's just much more complicated than we initially thought. GROSS: OK, well, (laughter) you have an interesting job. Thank you so much for telling us about it. MANJOO: Thanks so much for having me. This was really fun. GROSS: No, my pleasure. Farhad Manjoo writes The New York Times tech column ""State Of The Art"" and is writing a series on the tech giants he calls the ""Frightful Five: Apple, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Amazon.""

npr,"October 25, 2017",'Distracted Walking' Law Bans Texting While Crossing Streets In Honolulu," ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:  It's meant to keep pedestrians' eyes up and on the road while navigating crosswalks and city traffic. CHANG: It's thought to be the first law of its kind in any major city, and it's thanks to people in the very age group that gets a bad rap for always staring down at their screens - teenagers. SIEGEL: Teenagers in the Youth for Safety club at Waipahu High School outside of Honolulu. Kel Hirohata is their adviser. KEL HIROHATA: The club is just always kind of looking out. How can, you know, we impact our community? SIEGEL: Hirohata says his students spent a week or two just watching their peers cross the streets outside the school as they left at the end of the day. HIROHATA: We noticed that a lot of students were just looking at their cell phone crossing the street just kind of, like, following along the other students. You know, they weren't looking at all. CHANG: It seemed obviously dangerous, so they got a local councilmember involved, and eventually they helped write a bill. They testified at city council meetings. And ultimately their bill was signed into law. SIEGEL: Fines start at $15 and go as high as $99 for a third-time offense in the same year. But Hirohata says he hopes the law just makes looking up second nature the way laws of the 1980s influenced seatbelt use. HIROHATA: You know, fast forward 25 years, 30 years later, and basically all of my students - when I ask, hey, what do you guys do when you get into the car; you know, what's one of the first things they do - is put on our seatbelt. CHANG: Hirohata happens to also teach drivers ed, and vigilant walking is something he's been preaching long before this legislation. HIROHATA: As you cross the street, you need to make eye contact with the driver, you know - that, hey, I'm crossing the street. I mean, I think this law helps with that - that, hey, get your eyes up, and look around. Be aware of your surroundings. SIEGEL: And one other important note - pedestrians of any age can be fined. So parents, if you are traveling to Honolulu, keep your little one's eyes off the tablets and up on the road. (SOUNDBITE OF MELODIESINFONIE'S ""LATENIGHTWALKING"") Copyright © 2017 NPR.

npr,"October 24, 2017","SecureDrop, Encrypted System For News Tips, Announces Fix For 'Vulnerability'"," During a very short window of time, as a SecureDrop server was being set up, a sophisticated attacker with advance knowledge of the installation could hypothetically have attacked the server. Sources' identities would still be concealed, but the attacker could have gained access to all the material sent between sources and journalists. Cybersecurity experts say that while it's impossible to definitively prove that no attack occurred, the odds are extremely low. If it did happen, says Matthew Green, a cryptographer at Johns Hopkins University, ""it seems like there's a good chance you would see some evidence."" But after examining installation logs from multiple organizations, ""we have no evidence that this happened, or indeed anyone knows about the bug,"" says Jennifer Helsby, the lead developer of the SecureDrop platform. SecureDrop is an open-source tool used by many news organizations, including NPR, as a way for sources to provide documents and information without revealing their identity. Versions of the tool date back to 2013 and are designed to enable whistleblowers to work with investigative reporters. Many organizations, including NPR, have now reinstalled SecureDrop with the newly released fix. Helsby suggests that worried sources who want to use SecureDrop could encrypt data before they upload it and use a tool provided in the security-oriented Tails operating system to strip metadata from documents. ""Like all software, there's always the chance of vulnerabilities,"" she says. Nicholas Weaver, a computer scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, notes that a determined attacker could always send a person to physically compromise a server. And Green says that while the SecureDrop system is designed to provide some protection even if the server is compromised, ""there's no way to build a perfectly secure system for this purpose."" Sources should take additional steps to protect themselves, like never sending original documents and avoiding scanners, which can add revealing watermarks, he says.

npr,"October 19, 2017",Amazon's 2nd Headquarters: Cities Make Their Final Pitches," ALINA SELYUKH, BYLINE: Hi, how are you? M. KELLY: So how many cities exactly have thrown their hats in the ring here? SELYUKH: I think it's pretty much every major metropolitan area. My inbox has been flooded with press releases about cities pulling all kinds of stunts. You've got Kansas City mayor buying a thousand items on Amazon, giving them five-star reviews. Tucson sent a giant cactus in a truck up to Seattle. There was a dramatic offer from a suburb of Atlanta to create a whole city named Amazon. M. KELLY: Not subtle efforts here. SELYUKH: Cities are truly enamored. Amazon is promising 50,000 jobs, an average salary of a hundred thousand dollars. But also, this is one of the fastest-growing companies out there. So there's definitely the sense that if you nab the Amazon HQ2 you're buying into the future. M. KELLY: And when you say buying, I mean, aside from giant cactuses and lighting up buildings in different colors, are cities throwing money at this bid as well? SELYUKH: That's been a big part of the conversation. When Amazon asked cities to pitch themselves, the company asked for all kinds of information - you know, how far is the airport? How's the university scene? But also, there is this direct ask for essentially taxpayer-funded subsidies. And this is pretty common. Companies regularly pit states and cities against each other like that. But so far with Amazon, the public response has been mixed. On the most extreme end there is an example from New Jersey. They're offering up to $7 billion in tax incentives for a project in which Amazon... M. KELLY: Seven billion, wow. SELYUKH: For a project that Amazon itself has pledged to invest $5 billion in. M. KELLY: What about, Alina, smaller cities that maybe don't have that kind of money to throw at this bid? Is there any shot this might go to somewhere that's not a big city on the coast? SELYUKH: Some cities are hoping for that. There's one city in particular that I actually think about quite often. It's Gary, Ind. It's a small legacy steel town. And the mayor there took out an ad in The New York Times that honestly read like an SOS. They were saying, we totally get it. We're a far-fetched choice. But isn't America the land of far-fetched successes? And to me, that's a very interesting undercurrent that's running through this, this deep hope that maybe Amazon would make a choice that's sentimental, decide to build a second headquarters not somewhere on the coast where frankly 50,000 tech jobs might happen with or without Amazon, but in a place like Detroit or Indianapolis or Gary, Ind., where it could lift a whole community. M. KELLY: Realistically, though, how likely is that to happen? I mean, Amazon is a business. They're going to make a business decision. SELYUKH: Amazon as an emotional company is hard to imagine. Honestly, my image of Amazon selecting a city is like a room with spreadsheets being crunched by computers. But I did get a different kind of image of Amazon from Dow Constantine. He's the executive of King County in Washington state. His office is just blocks away from the Seattle headquarters. And he says Amazon is just now figuring out its role as a corporate citizen the same way Microsoft did 20 years ago. Here's what he said. DOW CONSTANTINE: I'm very confident that Amazon is going to continue to grow its business and continue to grow as a major social and civic player. SELYUKH: And he really is sticking to that belief. He and a neighboring county are going to bid for the second headquarters as well. M. KELLY: And do we have any idea when Amazon might announce their decision? SELYUKH: My expectation - early to mid-next year. M. KELLY: All right. Thanks, Alina. SELYUKH: Thank you. M. KELLY: That's NPR's Alina Selyukh updating us on today's deadline for cities to bid for Amazon's second headquarters. (SOUNDBITE OF LIL SUPA SONG, ""LUZ"") Copyright © 2017 NPR.

npr,"October 19, 2017",What You Need To Know About The Honest Ads Act," Virginia's Mark Warner is 1 of those 3 senators. He's also the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, and he joins us now from the Capitol. Welcome, Senator Warner. MARK WARNER: Thank you, Mary Louise. KELLY: So you are calling this bill you've introduced today the Honest Ads Act. Tell us briefly what it would do. WARNER: Well, over the last nine or 10 months, I've been saying to the social media companies, you've got to come clean with the level of Russian interference. And slowly we're getting this information that there were thousands of paid ads, that there were false accounts. We saw a report yesterday that there was a fake account on Twitter that was representing itself as the Tennessee Republican Party. We're saying in this new era where over half of Americans get their ad from - their news from social media, if you advertise politically on social media, you need to disclose what group is advertising, and there ought to be a place where people can go look at the content, the same kind of requirements that already exist if people were to advertise on NPR or on television or on - in news print, equalizing the playing field. And then one other thing would do... KELLY: Sure. WARNER: We're simply asking the companies to make a reasonable attempt so that if that ad is being paid for by a foreign agent, that they will try to reveal that foreign agent since that's already against the law for a foreign government to interfere in American elections. KELLY: And to be clear, would this apply to ads that mention a specific candidate, mention a specific party? Would it also apply to ads that tap into issues like gun control or race? WARNER: There are already established rules that apply to TV and all existing media that obviously would apply to specific candidates. But there are issue ads that fall into a category of what's called national significance that would also have to have this disclosure and this ability that there could be a file where the public could go look at the content of those ads. I've run for elected office four times in Virginia. There have been ads for me and against me. I think I ought to be able to go look at the content of those ads that are against me. And I think somebody ought to be able to go out look and see what kind of ads are running for me. What we've tried to do is a very light touch. We don't want to slow down innovation. We don't want to slow down individuals' willingness to use the Internet or use these social media platforms. But in an era where $1.4 billion was spent on political advertising in the 2016 campaigns - and that number's only going to go up - there needs to be equality between traditional radio and broadcast and social media and Internet political advertising. KELLY: Well, how do you rate your chances of getting this passed? You've got Senator McCain - John McCain, Republican senator from Arizona, as one of your co-sponsors. Do you think you will be able to get enough Republican votes onboard? WARNER: I hope so. There's an awful lot of Republican senators who are anxious to hear what the social media companies - Facebook, Twitter, Google - they're going to come before the Senate Intelligence Committee on November 1. I think these companies have finally realized how serious this challenge is. They rely in many ways on the trust of the folks who use these platforms and read their news over the Internet. So I think they want to come forward. I think a lot of Republicans will support after that. And I also hope candidly that these companies who say they acknowledge that they need to do a better job of sorting through some of this content, of making sure that there's not foreign-paid advertising coming into our American political system - I hope they end up supporting the legislation as well. KELLY: You - in the few seconds we have left, you acknowledge that this bill would be a light touch, meaning it leaves a whole lot of the issues raised by Russian meddling unaddressed. Can you give us any kind of timeframe on where your committee is in investigating that, when we're going to hear your conclusions? WARNER: My hope is we will get this done as quickly as we can as long as we can get to the bottom of the truth. KELLY: End of the year? WARNER: Whether that's done by the end of this year, beginning next quarter - I think it's going to be tough to see it done by the end of this year. But we... KELLY: OK. WARNER: We want to get this done as quickly as possible, but we've got to get to the facts. KELLY: Good to speak with you, Senator. WARNER: Thank you, Mary Louise.

npr,"October 19, 2017",Should College Professors Give 'Tech Breaks' In Class?," In real life, jamming technology is illegal in this country. But it's no fiction that college professors may go to great lengths in response to students using cellphones and other computer devices inappropriately in class. Writing for The Huffington Post last year, Robert Shuter described some professors' ""extreme measures to manage students' digital devices."" These include, he writes: ""public humiliation, personal reprimands, and disabling wireless access. For example, one instructor disclosed to us that, when he catches a student peering at a website unrelated to the class, he jokes publicly that the individual is watching pornography in order to shame the student. A professor teaching graphic design in a mediated classroom said she projects on the classroom screen, for all to see, what's on the offending student's computer. Several professors told us that they confiscated the phones of offending students. Another professor attempted to use an illegal cellphone jamming device he bought in China, but it didn't work.""  When I taught, my own approach was to allow technology in the classroom with the clear expectation that each student would use it wisely, staying off Facebook and Twitter — and without any form of public shaming when this expectation was violated. Certainly, students with disabilities of all types, visible and invisible, documented and undocumented, may benefit from the ability to use laptops, for example, in the classroom — and not necessarily through seeking a special accommodation that singles them out as different. Near the end of my teaching career, I did inform students about research along the lines of what Tania Lombrozo has described, showing that students' embrace of devices even for ""good"" purposes in the classroom may, in some cases, interfere with learning. This whole topic shot to the forefront of my consciousness again when I read Ben Gose's piece ""A New Generation of Digital Distraction"" in a special section of The Chronicle of Higher Education published last month. Gose described ""the new crop of traditional-aged students,"" those born between 1995 and 2010, who ""have been dubbed 'digital natives' for their comfort with — and addiction to — devices like smartphones."" Gose cited a recommendation by Larry D. Rosen, emeritus professor of psychology at California State University-Dominguez Hills: These digital natives should be offered a one-minute tech break in the classroom to check and send messages on their phones. More specifically: ""Instructors should initially schedule the breaks every 15 minutes, [Rosen] says, but then gradually increase the time between breaks to teach students to focus."" I was a bit stunned by this notion. A break every 15 minutes, for college students? How is the professor to concentrate on coherent presentation and the students to follow the thread of her or his argument, with so many disruptions? Isn't this treating college kids like, well, children? I emailed Rosen to probe a little further. While there's been no formal research on the idea of starting out with a break every 15 minutes, then increasing the intervals between breaks, Rosen told me it succeeds in practice according to the reports he hears anecdotally from professors. Here's a selected part of our Q&amp;A; (edited for length and clarity): What do you say to critics who'd point out that college students should be expected to have an attention span in the classroom greater than 15 minutes from the start, and this sort of accommodation is going too far, coddling students? They are blaming the wrong people! College students are still dealing with a prefrontal cortex that is likely not finished being myelinated which allows for better transmission of information between brain areas, so they are ripe for distractions. Also the technology sector, who I refer to as attention merchants, have designed the tech world to grab your attention from whatever you are doing to the next shiny object on your phone or computer or tablet or watch or wherever.... Tech companies work hard to capture your attention and if you are working with an immature prefrontal cortex you are more easily distracted. You've done research on the impact of classroom text message interruptions on comprehension and written a book (with Adam Gazzaley) called The Distracted Mind: Could you summarize your main message for college educators in terms of effective teaching of distracted minds? Understand that your students have a short attention span. We have watched students study something very important and even with us watching them they only attend less than 10 of the 15 minutes. The biggest distractors are any technology that involves communication (social media, texting, email, etc.) We also know that when not allowed to access their smartphones, heavy users (our college students!) start to get anxious within 10 minutes and continue to get anxious unless allowed to check in. That anxiety works counter to attention and comprehension of lecture material. One option is to ban technology in the classroom but that will never work since we know that the typical college student checks their phone every 15 minutes or less — and a recent study with an app monitoring smartphones showed that they checked their phone 50 times a day for a total of 262 minutes or about 5+ minutes per check-in. So then, for Rosen, we're back to the idea of those very frequent breaks at first, working toward the goal of a single tech break per class. Even though I'm not a faculty member anymore, I do get invited to college campuses to talk about my work in anthropology. Last week, I taught a seminar on animal cognition and emotion for the Oklahoma Scholar-Leadership Enrichment Program (OSLEP) at the University of Oklahoma. For 4 1/2 days, 19 students from higher-ed institutions across the state joined me in the classroom. One thing I noticed right away was that, unless we were engaged in a collective activity requiring the use of personal computers, students kept their laptops shut and took notes by hand. (That was their choice, not a requirement of the seminar.) Yes, the students' cellphones were always near. When we took bathroom or stretch breaks at my discretion, all of us checked our phones: I did, too. But very rarely did a student attend to his or her device instead of to lecture or discussion. Sure, it's possible I missed some moments of inattention (though students were arrayed in a semicircle right in front of me and there was no place to hide!). And when we took a field trip to a museum one afternoon, I was sorry to see that some students devoted time to their phones that could have better been spent exploring the exhibits. What I didn't see was a group of easily distracted students or students enslaved by technology. What explains this happy outcome over several intense days? Was the seminar so compelling that it held students' attention? (Hey, a teacher can always dream.) Was it because these students were honors-level and highly motivated? (This was almost certainly a major factor.) There's a genuine issue in higher ed to contend with here, one I don't deny. Digital natives' brains are still maturing, it's true, and sometimes (let's be wary of across-the-board stereotypes) they do use their personal tech devices inappropriately. The conversation regarding what to do about this will be ongoing. Surely, though, one big key is to have high expectations of students: to convey to them quite explicitly that the college classroom is a special place where important things go on, and where they can and will rise to the occasion and contribute by way of their focused attention and participation.

npr,"October 19, 2017",Young Children Are Spending Much More Time In Front Of Small Screens," That's a huge leap from 52 percent just six years ago. Mobile devices are now just as common as televisions in family homes. And the average amount of time our smallest children spend with those handheld devices each day is skyrocketing, too: from five minutes a day in 2011, to 15 minutes a day in 2013, to 48 minutes a day in 2017. James Steyer, CEO and founder of Common Sense Media, calls this ""a seismic shift"" that is ""fundamentally redefining childhood experiences"" with ""enormous implications we have just begun to understand."" Other eye-grabbing highlights from the survey: The growth of mobile is a dramatic change. But other aspects of kids' media use have been more stable over time, this periodic census reveals. When you take every source of screen media together, children 8 and under spend an average of about  2 1/4 hours (2:19) a day, a figure that's flat from 2011 (2:16). That implies mobile is apparently cannibalizing, not adding on to, the boob tube and other types of media. And, whether young kids are looking at small screens or big ones, most often they are passively watching videos, not using interactive apps. Video watching has dominated children's media use for decades. Finally, young children are still being read to by their parents about 30 minutes a day. More questions than answers What does all this mean? Researchers don't really know, and that concerns observers like Pamela Hurst-Della Pietra, the founder of Children and Screens: The Institute of Digital Media and Child Development. ""How different is the brain of a child who's never known anything but sustained digital media exposure to the brain of her parents, or even older siblings?"" she asks. ""And what are the implications for parents, educators or policymakers?"" Hurst-Della Pietra says these are questions ""we're only beginning to ask, let alone answer."" Children and Screens is getting ready to release its own series of reports that sets an agenda for future research. Steyer, of Common Sense Media, agrees. ""I would argue there are big implications for brain and social-emotional development, many of which we don't know the answer to,"" he says. The public conversation about kids and screens is somewhat schizophrenic. American schools, even preschools, are buying millions of electronic devices, and there are tens of thousands of apps meant to enhance learning for even the smallest babies. On the other hand, doctors warn, and parents worry, about negative effects from too much screen time, ranging from obesity to anxiety. One part of the Common Sense report that really plays up this contradiction is the section on the so-called digital divide. The phrase reflects the idea that learning how to use computers and the Internet at home helps kids get ahead in school and in life. Unlike in previous years, this census shows both rich and poor families now appear to have nearly equal access to smartphones. At the same time, kids from lower-income families are spending twice as much time with screens daily as those from the most advantaged families. Is this a boon or a danger?

npr,"October 18, 2017",Why There's A Lot Of Buzz About A Possible Mosquito Emoji," Everything from a butterfly to a croissant to a unicorn. But global health advocates think there's one important emoji that's missing: the mosquito. It is, after all, the world's deadliest animal. The diseases it spreads, like malaria and dengue, cause one million deaths a year. That's why the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation (which is a funder of this blog) and the Johns Hopkins Center for Communication Programs are lobbying intensely for a mosquito emoji. Having a mosquito emoji would be a welcome change, say Cornell University doctoral students Talya Shragai and Kara Fikrig, who study mosquitoes. Because really, using a sword next to a butterfly or a bee paired with a caterpillar — some of the emoji workarounds they've seen and used in text messages and tweets — just isn't good enough. Now the proposal for a mosquito emoji made it onto a list of 67 finalists that could be available on smartphones and electronic keyboards next year. Other finalists include a sliced bagel, a woman's flat shoe and a frowning pile of poo (which would, if approved, join a smiling pile of poo). (Editor's note: Because our boss is a lacrosse lover, we should note that a lacrosse stick is a deserving finalist.) Now it's easy to imagine how popular a lacrosse emoji would be. But why do we need a mosquito emoji? The idea, say the skeeter backers, is to use it in informal messages that raise awareness about mosquito-borne diseases. ""Not to downplay the importance of the poo emoji, but I think we could have a real impact with [the mosquito emoji],"" says Jeff Chertack, senior program officer for malaria advocacy and communications at the Gates Foundation. He helped write the proposal for the mosquito emoji along with Marla Shaivitz, a digital communications manager at the Johns Hopkins Center for Communication Programs. Before they appear on your smartphone, potential new emojis need to go through a process that's more difficult than you might expect. A detailed proposal needs to be submitted to the nonprofit Unicode Consortium, complete with an image of the proposed emoji and a host of other requirements. Unicode reviews the proposals, chooses the finalists and fine-tunes them. Chertack gave a ""nerve-wracking"" presentation about the mosquito emoji to a Unicode committee. ""I was strangely nervous for that presentation, mainly because there's a lot of power in that room. You've got Apple, Google, Adobe ... the sort of folks who decide what goes in devices in perpetuity,"" he says. ""I actually brought with me a very large board that showed that mosquitoes are the deadliest animal in the world, which always gets people really interested."" And it wouldn't be the first emoji that helps send a message about disease. PATH's Defeat DD initiative, which focuses on diarrheal disease in low-income countries, often uses the smiling Pile of Poo emoji in tweets, Facebook posts and social media campaigns. ""We've always been decidedly playful in our approach, as a very purposeful way of talking about an uncomfortable topic,"" says Hope Randall, a communications officer at PATH. In 2015 and 2016, they photoshopped a poo emoji they called ""Traveling Poo"" onto images of different places and a world map to draw attention to clean water and sanitation. And like the pile of poo, the mosquito would have other applications. ""It also could be used in terms of, this person's really annoying me and bugging me,"" says Chertack. The final emoji candidates won't be selected until January, says Mark Davis, president and co-founder of Unicode and chair of the emoji subcommittee. But the mosquito's chances are looking good. It would be unusual for any finalist to be taken off the list, says Jennifer 8. Lee. She's a former New York Times journalist who created Emojination, a grassroots group that advocates for the creation of new emojis, after she realized there was no dumpling emoji. All the Gates Foundation and Johns Hopkins have to do now is wait for Unicode to announce the winning emoji. Maybe then they could use the world's most popular emoji to express themselves: ""Tears of Joy."" Courtney Columbus is a multimedia journalist who covers science, global health and consumer health.

npr,"October 10, 2017",Elite Golden Keys Concierges Try To Stay Relevant Amid Growing Automation," In the movie ""The Grand Budapest Hotel,"" the unique role of the concierge was front and center. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL"") OWEN WILSON: (As M. Chuck) Good evening, Mr. Desgoffe und Taxis. I'm Monsieur Chuck. We've booked you and your sisters into the King Ferdinand Suite. SIEGEL: They know it all. They can do it all with panache. But since that movie came out three years ago, the number of luxury hotels actually employing concierges has dropped by nearly 20 percent, according to the American Hotel and Lodging Association. Here's Bobby Allyn of member station WHYY on the struggle to keep the profession alive. BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: Until now, I'd never spoken to a concierge. I'm a 29-year-old reporter. When I travel, it's usually on the cheap, and I go where the apps tell me to go. Jeannie Green is kind of like me. In the lobby of a Philadelphia hotel, she pulled out her phone and fired up the restaurant-booking app OpenTable. JEANNIE GREEN: I select Dinner Tonight, and I kind of just, you know, scroll of what's available for the area and where I see four and a half stars (laughter). ALLYN: Green did this while walking right past the hotel concierge station by the entrance. But some concierges don't want to let this happen. So they're coming out from behind the desk. ROBERT MARKS: More and more people are so tired of looking down at their laptops and their iPads and iPhones that they actually are enjoying the human one-on-one interaction and the eye contact. ALLYN: That's concierge Robert Marks. He says here, one of his colleagues might come up to you in the lobby with their own iPad in hand to show you what the service is all about. MARKS: And actually having someone that takes a true, vested interest in their well-being and their needs. ALLYN: He's not just any concierge. He's the U.S. president of Les Clefs d'Or, French for The Golden Keys, the international society of highly trained concierges. The idea of being taken care of is what The Golden Keys vowed to push at a recent national meeting. And it's exactly what Therese Leach wants when she travels for work. THERESE LEACH: I want to be able to not have to worry about things. And I think that's what a concierge can help with, too - is arranging for tickets and reservations and, like, that kind of thing. ALLYN: At Philadelphia's Sonesta Hotel, concierge Fran Nachman thinks a desire for the nostalgia could lure people in. She pulls out her Rolodex of connections. There's not even room to jam in another card. Then she takes out another thick binder. This is what she would reference if a guest asked for, say, a good steakhouse. FRAN NACHMAN: I have my menu book. And I have a section that has steak. We've got Chops. We've got Davio's. We've got Fogo, Morton's, Prime Rib. Yep, lots of steakhouses. ALLYN: Isn't Google a little easier than this? Nachman, who wears the signature golden keys of her profession on her lapel, insists that she's got something extra, the inside track and knowing the right people. NACHMAN: Calling the restaurant manager and saying, can you squeeze somebody in? If you can't do it 7:30, can you do it at 8? ALLYN: Another thing the concierge fraternity is doing to bring people in - pushing their success stories, like when a bride found that her dress was trapped at the dry cleaners the day of her wedding. She was frantic. She was staying in the San Diego hotel overseen by concierge Marks. He offered to take her shopping or to find her another dress. MARKS: None of those were options she was willing to accept. ALLYN: So he tracked down the number of the security company monitoring the dry cleaners, reached them and got the contact of the owner, who met him at the shop, unlocked it and handed Marks the dress. MARKS: So crisis averted. Happy bride. ALLYN: When it comes to making distraught brides happy, Marks says there isn't an app for that. For NPR News, I'm Bobby Allyn in Philadelphia.

But eventually text messaging, Google's GChat and Facebook took over, while AIM never fully figured out the shift to mobile. That led to AOL's fall from grace, going from being valued at $224 billion in today's money to just $4.4 billion when it was sold to Verizon in 2015. For context on the business AOL let slip away, WhatsApp sold that same year to Facebook for more than $19 billion.""

npr,"October 6, 2017",Should You Leave Grandma With The Robot?," Should you be scared by this proposition? Based on a lecture I just attended, my answer is: ""absolutely, but not in the usual 'robot overlords' kind of way."" Instead, the real fear should be about getting human beings wrong, not getting AI right. The lecture I attended was given by Rana el Kaliouby. She is a brilliant scientist who works on giving computers the ability recognize the emotions of humans they interact with. More than just an academic, she is also an entrepreneur. El Kaliouby is CEO of Affectiva, a company whose ""AI humanizes how people and technology interact."" But while El Kaliouby's presentation was thrilling (she is a truly engaging speaker), the longer the lecture went on, the more troubled I became. The essence of the technology that Affectiva pioneers is the ability of computers to recognize human emotions based on the ""activation"" of muscles in the face. The link between facial expressions and emotions is, of course, something we humans all know how to read. But researchers have gone beyond the gross characteristics of ""smile"" vs. ""frown"" to map out groups of facial muscles and their links to specific emotional states. The AI built by Affectiva can identify the positions of facial muscles and uses them to infer the emotional state of its user. Then the machine responds in ways that take that emotional state into account. (The company is also working on identifying emotions using speech.) One potential application for the technology's use would be to provide ""emotional robots"" for the elderly. Having a machine that could converse in an empathic way would give an older person without much human contact ""someone"" to spend time with. The fact that this is even possible is pretty remarkable and serves as a testimony to how far and how fast our machines have come in the ability to react to environments (including us). But as more potential applications of the technology were discussed in El Kaliouby's lecture, the more it became clear to me how the technology is also a kind of trap we are preparing for ourselves. We often like to say that technology is ""value free."" Scientists make their discoveries and engineers build their inventions, and these are all free of ""values."" It's society that adds those in. But I have never bought fully into that equation. All research occurs in cultural settings. Why are some research questions considered important (and worthy of funding) while others are deemed uninteresting? The answer to this question is always colored by the culture in which the researchers live. More importantly, research programs can come with a raft of philosophical baggage. These underpin the assumptions made in developing and carrying forward those programs. The assumption that lies behind emotional computing technologies is that facial states capture emotions. From the computers point of view, they are emotions. At the root of this equation is a reduction of human experience to neural programming whose outward manifestation can be captured algorithmically. The point here is not to begin an argument about the nature of consciousness. Instead, it's to see how technologies like Affectiva have built-in assumptions about what we are as humans. As the technologies are deployed in the world, they can reframe the world. In this way, technologies can rewire society in ways that can be hard to escape from. If you want an example, just think iPhones and social media. So imagine we get robots that keep lonely, older people company. That is a good thing right? But won't that also relieve us from questioning how we ended up in a society that warehouses the elderly because we don't know what else to do with them? Might there be other, more humane — and human — solutions than robots (that will be sold at a steep price by the robot companies)? Another example given in the lecture was something along the lines of allowing a family to watch different versions of the same show but each version gets tuned, in real time, to that family member's emotions. Perhaps the computer senses that brother wants a happy ending but sis wants everyone to die. I found this idea more than a little horrifying. It's not as if we don't live in our own bubbles enough now. Why provide more means to pull us away from shared experience? This led to another troublesome problem. The technology will clearly have useful applications, like developing learning apps for kids with autism. But it will be in the domains of sales and coercion that it finds its greatest deployment. Our ""emotion data"" will be used against us to make money, or worse, for someone else. But, at the root of it all, is the fact that ""emotion data"" is not the same thing as the real, vivid, present, enacted emotional experiences we have being human. Our emotions are not our faces or our voices. They aren't data. They can't be pulled out like a thread, one by one, from the fabric of our being. But once a technology that treats emotions as data becomes pervasive, we may soon find that data is the only aspect of emotion we come to recognize or value. Once billions of dollars flood into that equation, we may find ourselves trapped in a pervasive technology that flattens our experiences and reduces our lives. And that, more than robot overlords, is what scares me about AI.

npr,"October 6, 2017",How Monopoly Man Won The Internet," Monopoly Man became the Internet crush of the day on Wednesday, after upstaging former Equifax CEO Richard Smith at a Senate hearing on the company's massive data breach. The board game character, whose name is Rich Uncle Pennybags, was brought to life by Amanda Werner, an arbitration campaign manager for Public Citizen and Americans for Financial Reform, groups that advocate for consumer rights and protections. Almost immediately, the monocle, mustache, top hat, pillowcase-sized bag of (#fake) Benjamins became a social media sensation. The most unlikely viewers tuned in to the Senate Banking Committee hearing to watch Werner troll Smith, who was facing a roomful of angry senators after a hack that may have exposed the personal information of more than 145 million people.  People loved it. ""It was a very calculated move,"" said Werner, who prefers the pronouns ""they"" and ""them,"" adding that it was hilarious to watch the scene become a meme in real time. Werner mugged and preened for the camera and somehow, in a week dominated by sad and distressing news, gave people what they didn't know they wanted: a delightful reprieve. Here is how Werner staged the viral protest — without getting kicked thrown out of the Capitol. Oh, yeah...THIS happened today at the Equifax Senate hearing:Monopoly Man video-bombed!!#Equifax #monopolyman pic.twitter.com/eeSLaI8QNQ An alarm and an intern Werner has attended a slew of Senate hearings and has even provided pro-consumer rights testimony in some cases. That is how the activist knew that getting on TV is all about location — and staying within the camera's frame. The problem is that seats in the audience tend to fill up quickly, Werner explained. ""Luckily we have a very dedicated intern here,"" Werner said. ""He showed up at 7 a.m. and held a spot in line for me so that we could get that prime seat."" The one directly behind Smith, who was the target of the grilling. Apparently, the intern was the first person in line. During the hearing, Werner followed #MonopolyMan's rise to stardom in real time on a phone. Over Twitter, Werner was able to figure out the best angles as their head floated in and out of the camera's view. At one point Werner peered over Smith's shoulder using the monocle to inspect the back of the millionaire's head; at another point they knowingly stroked the perfectly shaped mustache glued to their face. Honed tone Werner set out to garner as much publicity as possible for the type of advocacy work Public Citizen does on behalf of consumers. ""We wanted to do something to get people's attention,"" Werner said of the hours-long photobomb, adding that people's eyes tend to glaze over when anyone utters the words ""forced arbitration."" Knowing that is the catalyst for coming up with creative protest ideas, Werner explained. They added that given the somber tone of news coverage around the deadly shooting in Las Vegas this week, the goal was to inject a little humor into public discourse. ""I think this week has been a particularly rough week on the American psyche so I think people needed a little bit of levity,"" Werner said. It certainly inspired tens of thousands of happy face crying emojis on Twitter and on Facebook. The decision to go the funny route is in stark contrast the health care protests on Sept. 25 during a hearing on the most recent Republican plan to replace the Affordable Care Act. Demonstrators began chanting, delaying the start of the hearing. Fifteen people were arrested and charged with disruption of Congress, according to U.S. Capitol Police. Dozens, staging die-ins in the hallway, were arrested and charged with crowding, obstructing or incommoding. ""There are a lot of different methods of protest and they all work for different instances,"" Werner said. ""You have to decide which is the best for your particular situation."" Ultimately, Werner argued, a good protest leads to action. The notoriety is great to call attention to the cause, they said. But Werner added, ""I hope that the effort [Wednesday] will make people not only laugh at the Monopoly Man and retweet these funny pictures but also to call their senators and tell them to vote no on SJ Res 47."" The bill would overturn a new rule intended to ban financial service providers, including banks and credit card companies, from using mandatory arbitration clauses to resolve their disputes and avoid class action lawsuits. Fashion statement, not statement statement There are certain lines that members of the audience at committee hearings cannot cross. They do not appear to be listed on the Capitol Police website, but here are a few guidelines that Werner has collected. Wearing a costume? That is allowed. Werner was a little concerned that the Capitol Police would not allow the top hat, but they didn't give it a second look. In fact, Werner recalls hearing a story about another demonstrator who dressed as Abraham Lincoln, complete with the beard and requisite foot-long stove pipe hat, and legend has it he was allowed to wear it throughout the proceedings. Holding up a sign? That is against the rules and can get people thrown out. Werner knew that going in, but that didn't stop them from briefly holding up a yellow ""Get out of jail free"" card that appeared on screen a few times. ""I didn't hold it up long,"" Werner confessed. ""I was a little afraid that as I was wiping my forehead with the $100 bill or doing other things that were calling a lot of attention to myself, that I might get warned,"" they said. But the only warning Werner received was for holding a giant bag of money on their lap, which they immediately set on the floor. Another word-of-mouth tip Werner has received: Writing messages on one's clothing is permitted. Hello! The Monopoly Man is here to raise attention to Equifax's get-out-of-jail-free card, forced arb. #RipoffClause https://t.co/RL7LF9ZtaX pic.twitter.com/9NjrzDxDlv NPR thanks our sponsors Become an NPR sponsor ",http://www.npr.org/555979792
npr,"October 5, 2017",Sen. Amy Klobuchar On Social Media Political Ad Disclosure," (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RICHARD BURR: The Russian intelligence service is determined, clever, and I recommend that every campaign and every election official take this very seriously as we move into this November's election and as we move into preparation for the 2018 election. GREENE: Now, one concern, of course, is Russia buying political ads on digital platforms like Facebook. And Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota plans to introduce legislation soon to address this. If a person or a group spends more than $10,000 on political ads on a big digital site, the company would have to reveal what audience was being targeted, also the contract information for the purchaser. And Senator Klobuchar is with us. Thanks for coming back, Senator. We appreciate it. AMY KLOBUCHAR: Well, thanks, David. It's great to be on. And this is such a serious issue right now when you think the 2018 election is only 397 days away. I knew you'd like to hear that... GREENE: Thank you for reminding me. KLOBUCHAR: ...Of course. GREENE: Exactly (laughter). KLOBUCHAR: But you think about - our whole democracy is formed on this simple idea that we wanted to be self-governing, right? GREENE: Right. KLOBUCHAR: And it - we didn't want to have foreign governments influencing us. Well, now we've learned that $100,000 was spent in rubles for ads during the 2016 election, and we haven't seen those ads. We really want to see them - the public does. Intelligence officials have seen them. But we think they should be released to the public. And what our bill does - Senator Warner and I are working on this together. And... GREENE: Your Democratic colleague Mark Warner, yeah. KLOBUCHAR: Exactly. And so what it does - and we're looking at different thresholds that are actually lower than the one you gave. But what it does is it says, when these things happen, you've got to register them. You have to put them out publicly when you buy a political ad. No, this is not about people posting cat videos if the cat talks about Donald Trump or Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi (laughter). GREENE: You're not worried about the cat videos. KLOBUCHAR: No. What this is about is paid political advertising, just like broadcast or radio has. So if I buy, as a campaign, a TV ad - or I buy a radio ad, then it has to be publicly registered - when the ad aired, who bought it, how much they bought. GREENE: Well, I'm glad - I don't mean to interrupt you, but I'm really glad you brought up broadcasters because are you basically saying that Facebook should be treated like a broadcaster? Is that where we are? KLOBUCHAR: They should be treated that way for paid ads - right? - paid ads - not for just content, people posting - not for news, but for paid ads. And that's exactly what broadcasters do. GREENE: So this won't take care of the problem... KLOBUCHAR: Go ahead. GREENE: This won't take care of the problem with, like, media posts from bots in Russia, if we're just talking about that. So it's a separate thing. KLOBUCHAR: OK, let's go to that. GREENE: OK (laughter). KLOBUCHAR: There's three things in the bill. One is to put them on the even playing field, which I think every American wants to know with this new technology when Facebook or Twitter or any of these online platforms can actually target them because they know their likes or they know what they're focused on - that that new technology isn't used by foreign governments or others to try to influence an election and dupe them, No. 1. No. 2, it requires these platforms to maintain a public file. So you know what's in these ads. You know how - when they're microtargeted, you don't even know that they exist sometimes - and digital copy of the ad. And No. 3 - and this gets to your question - that the online platforms have to make all reasonable efforts to ensure that foreign individuals and entities aren't purchasing political ads to interfere in our election - so in other words, that these foreign individuals and entities aren't purchasing them. And I'd like to add one more thing. Remember, these companies are selling ads. They're making money off of this. GREENE: Sure. But isn't - well, let me start with this. Who is going to enforce this? I mean, if you're treating them like a broadcaster, is the FCC going to do this? Are you going to create some new agency? Who's going to be... KLOBUCHAR: No, this is the Federal Election Commission, which is exactly where it should be. There are FCC rules involved, but it's the Federal Election Committee that has to put in place the rules when this passes. And if we don't do this - do you know how much money was spent last year on online ads, David, politically? GREENE: You tell me. KLOBUCHAR: $1.4 billion. And it... GREENE: And you think the FEC is - I mean... KLOBUCHAR: All hidden, all hidden. GREENE: But is the FEC, I mean, equipped to do this? Would there be a - need to be a lot more money for new jobs for people to be monitoring this stuff and enforcing it? KLOBUCHAR: Remember, it's the companies that are making money off this that are basically going to have to put in place these safeguards to safeguard our democracy. And then if they don't do it and complaints are being made, just like everything else, as the money is gravitating into these online ads, they have to be regulated. So I don't foresee some massive bureaucracy. I just see people doing the same thing that they do right now when complaints are brought to them about broadcast. GREENE: You know, I'm glad you brought up democracy because I wonder if you're worried at all that this is a slippery slope if you start regulating parts of the Internet. I mean, the Internet and freedom of the Internet is - it feels so democratic, in many ways. KLOBUCHAR: Yeah, that's what - I was just waiting for that question... GREENE: (Laughter). KLOBUCHAR: ...Because of course, we are not regulating news postings. We are not regulating when you post your kid's birthday party or you decide you're mad about the energy policy, about the Trump administration and you do a video yourself and you put it up. None of that will be regulated. These are paid ads - paid ads, just like we see on TV when you see the disclaimer, I paid for this message. That's what we're talking about, paid ads. But there are 1.4 billion. A lot of things you see on Facebook or Twitter or Google that maybe you don't think are paid - they are paid ads. And I think that people have a right to know - when we have elections where so much dark money is being spent undercover - that we have a right to know what's being spent. And we, as citizens, have a right to know that we're not being duped. GREENE: Did you say - I want to make sure I understand you correctly. Did you say that some of the financial burden for paying for this new enforcement would be coming from the companies? KLOBUCHAR: Well, of course. They are going to have to - and, you know, I come from the state of Target. If they can find one shoe in... GREENE: (Laughter) Minnesota, we should say. KLOBUCHAR: OK, yeah, OK - if they can find, because of a SKU number, some shoe that's in Hawaii, you know, I think that these guys who are able in other elections - in Germany - to not have political ads - they have to - that because of their law in Germany that say you can't have Nazi political ads, right? They are able to, in the French election, because they have different laws, go through and make sure that certain things that violate the law aren't on there. They are able to do this in other countries. Why, in the own country that they are based in, can't they do this? To me, with all of the technology and all of the brilliance we have at these companies, they can do this. They can make sure that paid political ads, which is a subsection of the postings they have - that they don't violate our law. And all that we're asking them to do is register those political ads. GREENE: Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, thanks so much. KLOBUCHAR: Thank you. Copyright © 2017 NPR.  All rights reserved.

""My job is to promote our good work, and I catastrophically failed in that last night."" But what Hopkins didn't anticipate — and we didn't either — was how much people needed something ""feel good,"" after back-to-back-to-back-to-back tragedies — the Las Vegas massacre and the devastation in Puerto Rico, Florida and the Texas Gulf Coast from hurricanes.

npr,"October 1, 2017",What Can We Learn About The Effects Of Social Media Ads?," To learn more about how the social media ad buys are supposed to work, we called Scott Tranter, director of analytics for a Washington, D.C., based data and technology firm. He's a Republican who ran digital analysis for Senator Marco Rubio's presidential run. I started our conversation by asking about the Russians' $100,000 ad buy on Facebook. SCOTT TRANTER: A hundred-thousand dollars is a drop in the bucket in terms of the amount of money you need to spend to get an impact online. And, you know, I think everyone's focused on, oh, $100,000 is a lot. Your average presidential campaign was probably spending anywhere from $10,000 to $100,000 a week for almost a year. So you can kind of see where $100,000 is a lot of money, but in the grand scheme of things, not necessarily a lot of money if you want to have an effect. So at least my opinion is I think if the Russians were really trying to do something and if it truly was them that we're going to find more. MARTIN: And so what's the goal here? What have we learned about what these ads were meant to do? TRANTER: When you're on the Internet, you're trying to - especially on all advertising - you're trying to evoke a response, right? So when we're doing a traditional political campaign, we want to evoke a response in the person we're speaking to, whether it be emotional, whether that be visceral or something like that. We want them to have a response to it and make a connection to our candidate. And so these ads were clearly divisive. They were designed to get a visceral reaction and create some action potentially at the voting booth or potentially in certain people's minds. MARTIN: So what does - is the goal to get people to vote? These ads don't really mention candidates, at least so far as we know. So what was the point there? TRANTER: I'll have to speculate outside my expertise but it's kind of like maybe they didn't necessarily want a specific candidate, they just wanted to create turmoil. Because if you create turmoil, then you muddy the waters and you make it difficult for everyone there. And if you look at it, a lot of these ads were played over a year ago. It's something that we're going to be talking about for a long time. So if you're the Russians, this is - whether or not you got the candidate you wanted, this is actually having an effect. MARTIN: You know, a number of far-right groups already promulgate the same kinds of information. I'm thinking about Breitbart, for example, which tends to be very interested in crimes committed by African-Americans. Similarly, there are African-American-oriented legitimate information sites which are very interested in reporting on misconduct toward African-Americans or particularly police misconduct toward African-Americans. And so how is what the Russians are - or what we believe the Russians were doing different from what these groups, which we know are run by Americans, are doing? TRANTER: You mean from a tactics standpoint? MARTIN: Yeah. How is it different? TRANTER: I would say the tactics are pretty standard. You're picking a hot-button issue. You're putting some explosive content or explosive accusations around it and you're trying to get people to react. They're adding amplification of a message. So, for instance, the ads we're specifically talking about, the ads around the Black Lives Matter stuff and specifically targeting Ferguson, specifically targeting around Baltimore, I mean, that was an issue that was widely - correctly covered on lots of local news, lots of national news. And then all of a sudden, they said, hey, here's a constituency that if we put ads in front, we're going to get them to respond. MARTIN: So for people who support Donald Trump and who are happy that he was elected, you know, setting aside the whole question of whether there was collusion or not because that's not at all what we're talking about here, but for people who are happy that he's elected and say, so what, so what that they did that, so what if it helped him, what would you say? TRANTER: Well, the fact that they were able to a use advertising medium that skirted around some of the regulations that the other political communications have is worrisome. As a practitioner, as an expert in this field, if I know that someone can spend some money and potentially affect a race that I'm in, I'm worried about that because our job is to play by the rules. Our job is to abide the law. And our job is to make sure that we target the right people with the right message. And so when I see someone coming in and spending money and affecting an outcome that we're supposed to not playing by the rules, yeah, we should be worried about it. And we're not talking about a football game. We're not talking about, you know, your kid's baseball game. We're talking about our democracy. So whenever we play around with that, we should be very careful and make sure that we understand how this is being played and who's being involved. MARTIN: That's Scott Tranter He's the director of analytics for a Washington, D.C., based data and technology consultancy. He was the former director of analytics for the Marco Rubio presidential campaign and he's working with a number of Republican campaigns in the Washington, D.C., area in this election cycle. Thanks so much for coming in. TRANTER: Thank you for having me. (SOUNDBITE OF LITTLE PEOPLE'S ""MOON"") Copyright © 2017 NPR.  All rights reserved.

npr,"October 25, 2017",How Black Americans See Discrimination," The results even surprised some of the actors of color; they felt they had been treated politely — even warmly — by the very real estate agents who told them they had no properties available to show them but who then told the white actors something different. The full scope of the disparate treatment often becomes clear only in the aggregate, once the camera zooms out. And yet obscured as the picture may be, black Americans take the existence of discrimination as a fact of life. That's according to a new study conducted by NPR, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, which asked black respondents how they felt about discrimination in their lives and in American society more broadly. Almost all of the black people who responded — 92 percent — said they felt that discrimination against African-Americans exists in America today. At least half said they had personally experienced racial discrimination in being paid equally or promoted at work, when they applied for jobs or in their encounters with police. Loading... But within that near-consensus, the respondents reported having different kinds of experiences with discrimination, which varied considerably depending on things like gender, age and where they lived. Take, for example, the question of whether discrimination that was the result of individual bias was a bigger problem than discrimination embedded into laws and government. Among the folks who said that discrimination existed, exactly half of all respondents felt the discrimination that black people face from individual people was a bigger cause for concern. But younger people were more likely to say they felt that institutional discrimination was a bigger concern. There was also a city-rural divide here, with people who lived in urban areas more likely to see this discrimination as driven by institutional factors as opposed to individual bias than those who lived in rural areas. Loading... How black people saw their neighborhoods The data from the survey show that black people who reported living in mostly black neighborhoods viewed their communities differently than those who lived in mostly non-black areas. For starters, they were much more likely to describe their community as a low-income neighborhood. And they had more negative views about their neighborhoods, too: Those respondents were more likely to say that crime, housing, the availability of jobs and grocery stores were worse than they were in other places. They were about twice as likely as black folks who lived in mostly non-black neighborhoods to say their local schools were worse off than other places to live. They were also more likely to say the police force in their communities were of a different racial background. Personal experiences with discrimination There were some stark differences in the way people in different income brackets said they experienced discrimination. Just about 2 in 3 people who earned more than $75,000 a year said that someone has referred to them or black people with racial slurs; less than half of all people who made less than $25,000 said the same. The same trend was true when respondents were asked whether someone acted afraid of them because of their race: Fifty-five percent of people who made more than $75,000 a year or more said this was true, compared with 33 percent of those who made less than $25,000 a year. Loading... The researchers did not attempt to posit any theories to explain why respondents answered differently based on their incomes. But what could be happening is that higher-income earners might live somewhat less segregated lives and have more chances to have more cross-racial encounters — and more negative cross-racial encounters. I ran this theory by Phillip Atiba Goff at John Jay College, whose specialty is the psychology of bias and racism. Goff was wary of speculating on statistics from a survey that he didn't conduct, but he offered this useful bit of context that he called ""the bind of black success"": Not only were higher-income black folks in more contact with white people, but they also more acutely experienced the stakes of being direct competition with them. ""The more proximity to inclusion is realistic, the price of exclusion is more pronounced,"" he explained. Policing and criminal justice At least half of the respondents said they had experienced discrimination or unfair stops or treatment by the police. Gender mattered here: Men were more likely than women to say that they had personally experienced discrimination in encounters with the police. Age mattered, too: Younger people were much more likely than people 65 or older to say that they or a family member had been unfairly stopped or treated by the police because they were black. But where people lived mattered a lot in people's feelings about policing. Suburbanites were much more likely to say they were treated unfairly than people in urban areas, and people in the Midwest and the South were much more likely than those in the Northeast to say that they or people in their communities experienced discrimination in dealing with the police. Loading... So what might explain the variation in feeling between suburbanites and city dwellers when it came to policing? The most common reason for contact with police is a traffic stop, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, so it could mean that black people who live in places where cars are more central to everyday life — people who live in the suburbs and not in denser, ""pre-car"" cities like those in the Northeast — are simply stopped by the police more often. Not surprisingly, the expectation of discrimination from the police also led many of the people surveyed — about 3 in 10 — to say they avoided calling the police when they were in need. (Low-income respondents were more than twice as likely to say they avoided calling the police.) That finding dovetails with recent research that found that high-profile local instances of police violence — and the subsequent erosion of trust in the police — makes people less likely to call 911. Taken altogether, these survey results aren't terribly surprising: They're backed up by the reams of data that show the extent to which African-Americans are far more likely to live in areas with concentrated poverty even when they are high earners, are more likely to go to segregated and underfunded schools, and more likely to be stopped by the police and searched once they are. Black folks are living objectively more difficult lives than similarly situated white folks. But here is a sobering thought: What if the black respondents to the NPR survey, who almost unanimously assumed that anti-black discrimination was a given, were like the people in the Urban Institute study and actually underestimating the drag that discrimination exerts on their lives? As data becomes more accessible and granular, we can more easily see how race is often the only variable that explains disparate treatment. If these responses are how people feel about discrimination based largely on what they can glean from their own direct experiences and commiserating with relatives and neighbors, it's not hard to imagine that the full picture is even less rosy than these data suggest at first glance. We're definitely not post-racial. And we like things complicated. For more on who we are, look here. Don't know what it means to ""code-switch,"" this will help.

npr,"October 25, 2017",'They Can't Just Be Average': Lifting Students Up Without Lowering The Bar," Charles Curtis is talking about the roughly 100 young, black men in the inaugural freshman class at Ron Brown College Prep, a radical new high school in Washington, D.C. Curtis, the school psychologist, puts it simply: ""There is no place in the world for an average black person."" Raising Kings is a three-part series from NPR Ed and Education Week. This yearlong collaboration tells the story of a radical new high school designed specifically for young men of color. Listen to the series here. So begins Part 2 in our series: Raising Kings: A Year of Love and Struggle at Ron Brown College Prep. The school is devoted to restorative justice, forcing students into uncomfortable conversations and face-to-face apologies instead of suspension or detention. There's also a high-expectations approach to academics, best told through the voices of two veteran teachers. Schalette Gudger, English teacher Gudger is a veteran teacher with 16 years of experience. Early in the year, she tells parents that she expects a lot from their young men: ""So, if I'm tough on them it's because I have high expectations for them. I'm going to be hard on them. Because I teach the language that helps them unlock the codes that we've been telling them to switch. ... And if they will allow me, I will give them what I have."" In the classroom, Gudger is always pushing her students to dig deeper. The vast majority of Ron Brown's faculty and staff are men. Ms. G, as she's known, thinks that gives her a unique perspective: ""What I have that works for me is, I'm Mom. So when they come in, they feel the same strict but loving environment that they feel at home. So it's like, 'OK, we can smile, we can laugh, we can joke, but we know this is serious business. We know that this is what is expected of our behavior.' It's the same thing with Mom. We may laugh and joke and play – we may even be disrespectful – but we know, at the end of the day, we need to bring it back in. We have a job to do."" Many of Gudger's students struggle with the daily challenges of poverty. Some have experienced violence and trauma. So she tries to be flexible. A student falling asleep, for example, shouldn't always be taken as an affront. It may indicate trouble at home: ""Some of them are so on edge that they literally do not sleep at night. So, if you need a break ... if you're comfortable enough here to put your head down, Baby, by all means rest."" Shaka Greene, math teacher Greene is also a veteran teacher who, like many of his students, grew up in poverty. ""I watched my mother work multiple jobs to make sure we ate. There were times I went to school with holes in my shoes. So I get it. That is why I am as hard on them as I am, because I know your circumstances don't matter as much as your will and desire to be successful."" Greene says he struggles sometimes to find the balance between showing his students love and preparing them for the world. ""If you leave high school and you still make a 600 on the SAT, nobody cares how much you were loved. Congratulations, you feel good about yourself. But you're still reading, writing and counting below average. And I am now a Google exec. And I don't want below average. I want the best of the best."" Greene's passion is chess. e runs the most popular after-school club at Ron Brown: chess club. And in the game, he sees a metaphor for these young men.  ""The key to chess, really the soul of the game of chess, are your pawns. If I'm able to get my pawn all the way to your last rank, this pawn can become any piece on the board that I want it to become other than a king or another pawn. Once you learn to value your pawns, you really start to learn to understand and grow at the game of chess.""

npr,"October 24, 2017",This Halloween: What Does It Mean To Call Something 'Spooky'?," So, you're at your friend's elaborately decorated Halloween party. There are cobwebs hanging from the ceiling, bloody handprints on the wall, a frothing potion brewing on the stove. It's creepy! And scary! But is it ... spooky? Sure, ""spook"" can refer to a ghost. It can refer to a spy. But as many of us know, it's also, sometimes, a racial slur for black people. One of our Ask Code Switch readers wrote in to ask about the etiquette of using words like spook and spooky. During this, the season of murder mysteries and haunted hayrides, is it insensitive to say that you were spooked? So here's the deal: Spook comes from the Dutch word for apparition, or specter. The noun was first used in English around the turn of the nineteenth century. Over the next few decades, it developed other forms, like spooky, spookish, and of course, the verb, to spook. From there, it seems, the word lived a relatively innocuous life for many years, existing in the liminal space between surprise and mild fear. It wasn't until World War II that spook started to refer to black people. The black Army pilots who trained at the Tuskegee Institute were referred to as the ""Spookwaffe"" — waffe being the German word for weapon, or gun. (Luftwaffe was the name of the German air force). Once the word ""spook"" was linked to blackness, it wasn't long before it became a recognizable — if second-tier — slur. But that wasn't the end of the story for spook. The word had a bit of a renaissance in the 1970s, with the release of the novel and classic film, The Spook Who Sat By The Door, by Sam Greenlee. Both the book and movie tell the fictional story of the first black man recruited and trained by the CIA. That man goes through his training, works for a little while, and then quits his job and moves back to Chicago, where he secretly trains a group of young black ""freedom fighters."" The title of the movie, of course, both refers to spook meaning ""black person"" and spook meaning ""spy."" And as a satirical piece of literature written by an African-American author in the years following the civil rights movement, the use of ""spook"" was infused with an extra dose of irony. Renee Blake is a sociolinguist who studies the way language is used in society, ""whether it's based on race, class, gender or the like."" She says she doesn't hear the word spook all that often, but she does have two salient reference points for it. The first is The Spook Who Sat By The Door, and the second is the 2000 book and 2003 movie The Human Stain, by Phillip Roth. His novel tells the story of a professor at a New England college who is forced to resign after he calls two African-American students spooks. The word spook hasn't just gotten fictional people in trouble. In 2010, Target apologized for selling a Halloween toy called ""Spook Drop Parachuters"" — literally miniature black figurines with orange parachutes. In light of all this baggage, I asked Blake what she thought about the use of words like spook and spooky during Halloween. She said that, while it's clear that spook has multiple, distinct meanings, it's still important to think about context. The way that certain words get attached to particular racial groups is incredibly complicated. (Take thug, for example.) ""Be thoughtful about the fact that [spook] now might have the connotation of referring to a black person in a disparaging way,"" Blake says. ""If someone says, 'Did you get spooked?' and there are no black people there, then, OK, you mean 'Did you get scared or frightened?' That's fine, I get it."" But once you insert black people into the situation, Blake says, it's important to be more tactful. ""We know that the word 'niggardly' doesn't mean a black person, but let's be sensitive. Are you going to use the word niggardly in front of a group of young students in a classroom? No."" So, this Halloween, be a little cautious when it comes to describing your surroundings. And don't be afraid of creeping into the thesaurus for a spooky synonym. To me, it's more fun to be aghast, bloodcurdled, or spine-chilled than ""spooked."" Got a race question for Code Switch?

npr,"October 21, 2017","When It Comes To Race And Sports, Who Owns An Athlete's Opinions?"," The NFL's players are 70 percent black; its fans are 83 percent white and 64 percent male, according to online sports site The Real GM. And when it comes to the controversy over the national anthem and players taking a knee, that statistic is playing a huge role. It leads to the idea, says Amira Rose Davis of Penn State University, ""that 'you are good as entertainment, but once you have a voice, I don't want to hear you. You need to shut up and play.' "" Some players, though, clearly are not satisfied to just play and be paid. And so the league is trying to figure out how to keep its owners happy while making sure players have some outlet for their social concerns. They began that discussion last weekend, but it won't be easily resolved Standing for the anthem: NFL policy, but not a rule This week, at the end of two days of meetings with owners and players, NFL Commissioner Rodger Goodell explained at a press conference that the league would be working with players on their interest in issues that affect their communities. Goodell said the league handbook would remain the same: It is policy that players stand for the anthem, but it's not a rule. ""We want our players to stand; we'll encourage our players to stand,"" Goodell said. He would not answer questions about what happens if individual owners choose to discipline their players if they take a knee. ""I'm not dealing in hypotheticals right now,"" he demurred. Owners anticipate more fan anger and more White House tweets. The controversy could be a watershed moment for the NFL and the sport. And the stakes are high. ""Sport has often been a site for not only the expression of tensions in society, but it's also been a laboratory of sorts,"" says Davis, an African-American assistant professor of history who studies gender, race and sports at Pennsylvania State University. ""This is an arena that is very visible,"" she adds. ""And if you can discipline a black body in this space, it sends a message to disciplining black bodies across the country."" Taking a knee You know the history of this: Then-San Francisco 49er Colin Kaepernick took a knee last year while the national anthem was being played. Kaepernick's contract was not renewed, and no team has picked him up. (This week, he filed a grievance against owners, saying they had colluded to blackball him.) Despite what critics say was intended by owners to be a chilling cautionary tale, more and more NFL players (most of them black) have joined Kaepernick in taking a knee this year, and America is not happy. Well, a lot of white America is not happy.  And that is an important distinction. Facebook videos show angry white men throwing their team jerseys, caps and posters in a pile and setting them on fire. Via tweets, President Trump is urging fans to boycott the NFL until it orders its players to stand during the anthem: ""total disrespect for our great country!"" Many owners, initially offended at Trump's directive, have changed their tune. The dispute comes as attendance and television viewership for the NFL have been sliding. And while it's unclear what effect the protests might be having on this, it's pretty clear the league is worried. Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, who linked arms with his team two weeks ago and took a knee before the anthem, has now promised all his players that anyone protesting while the anthem is being played will be benched and fined. Maybe worse. All this doesn't surprise Colorado College historian Jamal Ratchford. He is African-American and studies the nexus of sports, race and protest. ""Self-determination of black athletes has always been a challenge and infringed upon,"" Ratchford says. Think Muhammad Ali, who protested the Vietnam War by refusing to be inducted into the military. He was stripped of his title, fined and banned from boxing. Or Tommie Smith and John Carlos, gold and bronze track medalists respectively, who stood with upraised fists as the anthem was played during the Olympics in Mexico City in 1968. They were stripped of their medals, and upon their return home, Carlos was under FBI surveillance for years afterward. There were death threats, public shunning. Davis believes a lot of spectators aren't interested in athletes' political opinions. She adds that the kneeling protests as the anthem is played are being conflated with disrespect for the flag and the military; she believes the conflation is erroneous — and purposeful. Especially when it's used by prominent critics, like the president. ""Not about the flag or the troops"" The bended knees aren't about the flag, Davis says. ""This is about police brutality. This is what we experience as black people in America. This is not about the flag or the troops."" Davis notes that over and over, athletes have made that point. ""They've penned op-eds, done town hall debates and talked on news shows."" What the anger is actually about, Davis believes, ""is what happens when black bodies don't conform to what white spectators and consumers want them to be or do or say."" Jeffrey T. Sammons agrees. Sammons, an African-American professor of history at New York University, has looked at the role that race plays in boxing and baseball, among other sports. He believes football in particular has always had a militarized veneer: the playing of the anthem, the color guard that bears the flag on the field, the flyovers of fighter jets at some games all contribute to that. ""And there is a level of conformity that's imposed upon our athletes, who are supposed to be sort of like weaponless warriors."" Players — especially black players — who don't conform are often criticized for being ""spoiled, rich, undeserving brats."" What is often lost in the noise, Sammons says, is the fact that these ""brats"" are earning their lofty salaries for a few short years, while the injuries accrued during that time have lasted many for the rest of their lives. All three historians note that the money the players make is infinitesimal compared with what owners reap from their labor. White fans see red over black protest The implications of all this go far beyond football. Ratchford says the protests have been valuable as a tool to raise public awareness, but he is wondering about the long term. He believes a collective effort to address grass-roots concerns in black communities might be more effective than the kneeling demonstrations. The league's announcement this week that it will work with players on some of their social justice concerns may be a step in that direction. Bottom line: The fans want their game back. The owners want full stadiums. The players want their right to peacefully protest police brutality and racial injustice. Given those widely disparate interests, it's going to take skillful negotiations to bring these parties together. This week's meeting between players' reps and NFL owners may be a start. Ultimately, the question may boil down to this: Who decides when, and how, players — especially black professional athletes, who are all too aware that some of their ancestors actually were owned by others — can exercise their right to self-expression? We're definitely not post-racial. And we like things complicated. For more on who we are, look here. Don't know what it means to ""code-switch,"" this will help.

npr,"October 18, 2017",A Year Of Love And Struggle In A New High School," In the classrooms and cafeteria, they're kings. That's just one of the many things that stand out in this new boys-only, public school in Washington, D.C. The school opened in August 2016 to a class of roughly 100 young men. All are freshmen. All are students of color. All are determined to change the narrative. In Washington, and the rest of the country, that narrative says too many young black men are below-average readers. They're suspended from school at above-average rates and less likely to graduate than any other group. Ron Brown College Prep is a radical effort to change that. For the past year, NPR and Education Week have been reporting on the birth of this new school. Here are some of the adults who made it a reality: Ben Williams, principal Before the school opens, Principal Ben Williams has to recruit his freshman class, visiting middle schools around the city. To these packed auditoriums of teens, he spreads his message: This school will be different. ""Now, young men, I am excited about this. Excited about this! We're going to make history. My goal is: You walk in as young men, but you leave as men."" Williams says the Ron Brown approach to students is holistic: ""We're building [a school] where they feel loved, they feel like it's a safe space. They feel like it's a place where they can take chances, and where they can grow. Seeing that cultural shift is extremely exciting."" The CARE Team One of the many things that sets the school apart is its CARE Team, a group of roughly a half-dozen people, mostly men, including a psychologist, social worker and several counselors, who keep the students on track emotionally and academically. Their job is to get to know the students: strengths and weaknesses, who has a short fuse, who's living on a friend's couch. Charles Curtis, CARE Team leader and school psychologist ""We're at your house, we're in your face, we're in your business, we're caring about you, we're at your mama's funeral, in class when you're struggling."" In the U.S., schools often show zero tolerance for disruptive behavior. And suspensions hit black students especially hard. To change that, Ron Brown uses something called ""restorative justice."" ""Restorative justice restores me to the space that I should be. So, when we look at these young people, we're looking at them from a place of godliness, of kingliness, of royalty. And I don't mean that just in rhetoric. I truly mean it, like in their birthright. They deserve to be expected to be great."" Shatane Porter, school counselor Many of the students at Ron Brown come from poverty, explains counselor Shatane Porter: ""If [a student is] having a bad day, 'I haven't eaten, somebody got shot' – whatever the case may be — school is a safe zone for me. So this should be a place that I should be able to come and express my thoughts."" Even when that expression includes cursing in the classroom. Porter says teachers need to listen carefully and try to understand what the student is really trying to say and why he's saying it. What teachers at Ron Brown need, Porter says, is balance: between toughness, structure and love for the students. ""It can't just be 'I want them to have order in the class.' Because you're asking them to do something that they don't even have at home. If there's no order at home, you're asking me now to come to the school every single day to do something that I'm not used to doing."" Dawaine Cosey, CARE Team member ""I tell the guys all the time, 'You're going to get love, and there's really nothing you can do about it.' ... They're like, 'Is this real? Why don't y'all suspend me?' And I think that blows their minds. 'Why y'all won't send me home?!' 'Cause we can just talk about it, and y'all be fine."" But that makes the early days at Ron Brown really hard. Some students don't like the school's approach. They don't want to talk about compliments or community, about their feelings or their poor choices. But Cosey has faith they'll come around: ""Who plants a seed today and expects a harvest tomorrow? I don't. It's gonna be long. For most students, we're still tilling up the soil.""

npr,"October 5, 2017","A New Musical — And Its Audience — Grapple With Asian Identity, Through K-Pop"," It's my first interactive theater experience. I'm standing in a dark, large room with a stage in the middle. Other audience members are huddled around. We're not really sure what we've gotten ourselves into. Here's the premise: We've been asked to be part of a focus group run by a K-pop label. Its leaders have invited us to tour a Korean pop ""factory,"" where the stars hone their dancing and singing in Korean and English. We, the audience, are supposed to help figure out just why Korean megastars haven't been able to break into the American market. It's a real question, and it's the driving force of KPOP, a new, interactive musical in New York City with a nearly all-Asian cast. ""These are questions that I've been wrestling with my whole life,"" says 32-year-old Jason Kim, KPOP's writer who also worked for HBO's Girls. In 2014, while Kim was finishing up his MFA in playwriting at the New School For Drama, he partnered up with director Teddy Bergman and came up with the idea for KPOP. Working with theater groups including the Woodshed Collective, Ars Nova and Ma-Yi Theater Company, Kim set off to use K-pop to tell a story about the delicate, dotted lines between being Asian, American and Asian-American. And in the process of bringing the show to life, Kim took on another complicated question: Why haven't there been more Asian-centered major theatrical productions? I got a chance to see the show and talk with Kim about it. Here's a condensed version of our conversation: So, why K-pop? 
                Jason Kim, 32, is one of the co-creators of KPOP.

 I grew up in Seoul and I grew up listening to very early incarnations of K-pop. And I think K-pop has exploded in the last 10 years like no other music genre that I've ever seen before. It's become so vibrant and avant-garde and subversive and quirky and ironic and earnest at the same time. And so I really wanted to use what K-pop meant to me as a way to talk about what I was feeling about myself and about the culture at large. About identity issues, about race politics, about everything that I was seeing as a person. It seemed like a perfect way to talk about these things as a metaphor. What K-pop artists were you listening to? I became super obsessed with Girls' Generation when they started getting popular. And lately I've been super, super obsessed with BTS and also sort of the older artists who are still around who try to break into the industry who didn't quite make it for various reasons, like Rain. And I've always sort of wondered why they haven't had this huge break that I think they deserve. Why do you think they never got that break? You know this is a question that we raise in the show. And one of the questions that Jerry — the character [played by actor James Seol] who puts together this whole evening — asks the audience directly: ""Why has an Asian-American star never broken through in the U.S.?""... Some audience members are saying out loud everything ranging from ""because you guys are weird"" or ""because you guys are too 'stylized,' "" whatever that means, to ""because of systemic racism.""

 ""Special K"" is an all-girl group in KPOP. How does Jerry, as played by James Seol — react to that? He is such a wonderful actor in that he knows the beats that he has to hit in the script and, when needed, he can improv his way into those beats. And I think what to me has been such a wonderful learning experience as a viewer is that his reactions are real. So when people say, ""You guys are too stylized,"" he — I think for the right reasons — scratches his head for a second and thinks, ""What does that mean? What do you mean by too stylized? ... If you're Asian — does that mean you're too cute? Does that mean you're too sexy? Does it mean you don't sound like us?"" ... And so I think he's been having honest reactions to these answers. Why was it so important for you to have a show about identity?  I was born and raised in Seoul. I moved to the Midwest when I was 10 years old. And then I moved to New York where I've been for the last 10, 15 years. Throughout that time, I thought of myself as a Korean person, as a Korean-American person, as an American person. As a person who wants to be white, as a person who doesn't want to be white. As a person who wants to be the minority, as a person who doesn't want to be the minority. The narrative of the show feels to me like a narrative that many people experience when they start to think about identity. And for me that narrative has been, ""Oh, there's something different about me. What can I do to investigate that? And how do I 'fix' that to become something different, something — someone — else?"" And ultimately come to the realization that actually, this is not going anywhere. And I got to accept it for what it is. And that is really the narrative that I think the piece is trying to convey.

 Jason Tam is a singer in KPOP's all-boy group, ""F8."" Can you talk about the casting process? I think the casting process of KPOP could be its own musical. To be honest with you, we searched for a span of a year and a half almost two years. We have a phenomenal casting director, Henry Russell Bergstein who helped find, cultivate and really wrangle up 18 phenomenal performers. And to be honest we found everyone from a range of various backgrounds. Ashley Park is a Broadway star and has been in several musicals all over the country and is about to be in Mean Girls on Broadway. And you have someone like Jason Tam who has been in musicals since he was probably a fetus, and you have someone like Jiho Kang who has never been in a musical before, who we found on YouTube. You found him on YouTube? He had competed in a reality television program in Seoul. We called him in for an audition, and he is an applied math major, graduated from Harvard and is the smartest person that you've ever met in your entire life. And he was working for the government in Washington, D.C., and we said, ""Can you please hop on a train and come audition for us?"" And he came in and he sang and acted and dance and blew us away. We said, ""Will you please pack up your entire life and move to New York and do this production?"" I hear all the time people saying there's not enough Asian-American talent, there's not enough people of color who could play this role who or who could be stars. But that's not true. This was not, by the way, a unique case if you look at the story of our cast. Every single person has a story like this. ... It has been such a joy to be able to find too much talent. I hear all the time people saying there's not enough Asian-American talent, there's not enough people of color who could play this role who or who could be stars. But that's not true. What was your biggest fear in this entire process? Not necessarily with the creative team. But overall, what kept you up at night? I think that because the show both indirectly and directly deals with themes of identity and acceptance and race and and immigration, a lot of these scenes and songs and staging really hit very close to home. And I was always up at night thinking about the performers and knowing that we were asking them to not only be pop stars but think about these very big, deeply rooted issues and ask them to perform night after night and really engage with a part of themselves that feels dangerous and scary and vulnerable. What did you learn about your own identity throughout this process? I think I did learn that I can excavate feelings and memories and and thoughts ... about identity — and I could write about it for as long as I live, but I my maybe never understand it. And I think that's OK. One thing that I learned is that I might never understand it in a neat way. I think I did learn that I can excavate feelings and memories and thoughts, and academic papers and think pieces and other stories — whatever is available in the world about identity — and I could write about it for as long as I live. But I may maybe never understand it. And I think that's OK. And I think that's actually a really great thing that I have something that I can wrestle with for so long.

npr,"September 28, 2017","When The Parents Are White, The Child Is Black, And The Churches Are Segregated"," So is there anything parents can do to protect their kiddos (and themselves) from those grating interactions? This week, we're exploring these questions on Ask Code Switch — and in the podcast. Noelle,* from Roanoke, Va., asks: My husband and I are white and we have one biological child (a baby) who shares many of our physical features. We also have a 4-year-old daughter, whom we adopted, who is black. I am trying to surround our daughter with a multiracial community so she is less this one black person in a sea of white. That is a struggle in a city that is still pretty segregated, but my particular question is this: Where should we go to church? We visited churches for a year when we moved to town, trying to find one that was racially and ethnically diverse, among a couple of other parameters we had. In the end, we settled on a congregation that is almost exclusively white, but it's very uncomfortable to me to be raising my daughter in a church where we can identify ourselves as, ""We're that couple with the black daughter."" Should we go to a predominantly black church, even though it's not in our comfort zone as far as worship style? Would that be pretending to be something we're not as a family? Would we even be welcome there, or would we be intruding on a precious time for people of color to be in a safe space? Are there ways leaders of our church could make our congregation more welcoming to people of color? Half the time I'm tempted to just start my own congregation, because I can't seem to find one that looks like my family, much less like the diverse world we live in. Here's our answer: Hi Noelle, When we first read your question, a couple of people on the team thought of that famous quotation from Martin Luther King Jr.: ""It is one of the tragedies of our nation, one of the shameful tragedies, that 11 o'clock on Sunday morning is one of the most segregated hours, if not the most segregated hour, in Christian America."" It sounds like 50 years later, you're seeing a pretty similar landscape. Even in large, diverse cities, congregations are often racially homogeneous. Short of driving three hours to Raleigh, it might be tough for you to find a diverse church. So, what do you do? It sounds from your letter like you're probably living in a pretty white part of town, which means that your school district will be majority white. If many of the people in your extended family and social circles are white as well, there may be only one choice. You need to go to a black church. Let's explain. The first reason is your daughter. Studies have shown that children are able to pick up on racial difference as early as 15 months old, and by the time they're between 3 and 5, they're already starting to develop racial biases. Your daughter might not have the vocabulary to talk to you yet about what she's experiencing, but if you're uncomfortable being ""the couple with the black daughter,"" research suggests your daughter is uncomfortable being ""the black daughter."" And, no matter what you say to her about race, she's going to be soaking up messages from what she sees, where she goes and who she's around. I'm sure I don't have to tell you — the way that black people are portrayed in popular media (when they're portrayed at all) is not always the most affirming. I spoke to Beth Hall, the executive director of PACT, An Adoption Alliance, an organization that serves interracial adoptive families. Hall also wrote a book, Inside Transracial Adoption, and she's the white adoptive mother of a black son and a Latina daughter. She says it's extremely important for interracial adoptive families to foster intimate relationships with people who look like their kids. ""And intimacy is, who do you eat dinner with? Who do you love? And who do you worship with?"" she says. Children are concrete thinkers, Hall adds, so if they're surrounded by white people most of the time, they're likely to reason that white people are the ones most worthy of love and trust: ""So as [your daughter] grows up, who's she going to want to be like? Who's she going to want to be?"" When you grow up and who you want to be is not who you can be, Hall says, ""then how is she going to grow up not embodying some internalized dislike, if not hate?"" Noelle, the second reason I think you should attend a black church is the rest of your family. You're right, you might not always feel welcome in a black church. People will notice your presence, and there's no guarantee that everyone will like it. (A couple of folks have suggested introducing yourself to the church leadership ahead of time and explaining your presence — it could go a long way toward ingratiating you to the community.) But being somewhere where you're noticed, looked at, maybe even judged sometimes may help you empathize with what your daughter will experience throughout her life. Remember, you get to go home to a community, and generally live, in a world where your racial identity is the norm. She doesn't. P.S. If you haven't already, my teammate Gene Demby says check out NBC's ""This Is Us."" Interracial adoptees and parents: We want to hear from you! What advice would you give Noelle?

npr,"September 24, 2017","Goodbye, For Now, To A Vital Source For Native American News"," They say if you want something done right, do it yourself. But for Ray Halbritter, it was more a case of, ""if you want something done at all."" Halbritter, the CEO of Oneida Nation Enterprises, wasn't seeing stories by or about Native Americans in mainstream media outlets, and on the rare occasion those places did try to write about indigenous people, the stories often got distorted. So, in 2011, he acquired Indian Country Today — a 30-year old weekly newspaper that centered the voices of indigenous journalists. From there, he helped transform ICT into a multi-platform digital media network, which he says reached more than a million readers each month. For the next six years, the journalists at ICTMN wrote about some of the most pressing issues rocking Indian Country, from the resistance to the Dakota Access Pipeline to presidential politics to murdered and missing indigenous women. They also celebrated indigenous communities by profiling Native athletes, doctors and actors. But on Sept. 4, Halbritter announced the network was ceasing active operations. The business model, he says, was too expensive to be sustainable. But Halbritter believes the need for strong reporting on Native America is as urgent as its ever been. I spoke with Halbritter about the past, present and future of Indian Country Today Media Network. Below is an edited version of our conversation. So Indian Country Today Media Network is shutting down, for the time being. What happens next? There are some methods by which Native People are still getting some media. But we are exploring media opportunities that can meet the journalistic and organizational standards that we had set for ourselves. But the business model was just costly, and it just was not functioning well. We know that today, the media is always developing, with the internet, with cell phones, with Twitters and Facebooks and Googles. And there's a swirl of information around us all the time, instantaneously and individually, and that affects the kind of business model that we were initially involved in. So we are looking to find a way to — and we're currently in some talks with some various groups and stakeholders — to try to get some insights on how best to repurpose this publication in a way that's viable, both journalistically and economically. And we need to be sure we can find a way to express Native American thinking and thought. The truth and accuracy about us is fundamental for our future and our relationship in this world. What is missing in mainstream portrayals of Native Americans? In media, Native people are often looked at as relics or mascots. And there's so much more complexity, so much more beauty. There's struggle and nuance to the Native American experience in this country. We've experienced what it is to have people not understand you. Be afraid of you. Question who you are. We are real people with real lives. All of that is sometimes not understood, or even talked about or represented in mainstream media. There was such a great need [for Indian Country Today] because the perception and image of Native people was very many times inaccurately portrayed, and as a result, the truth about Native people was not always presented. You wrote in an open letter on ICTMN's website, ""We know that when we leave our stories to be told only by other media outlets, those stories too often go untold — or get distorted."" Can you talk about that? I think, generally speaking, the result of having inaccuracy in media distorts the way people see us, and as a result, it affects the way we're treated — whether it's the DAPL pipeline that was being dealt with in Standing Rock, or the way people view and understand us dealing with the NFL team name in Washington that is a racial slur. We understand that in some cases, people really don't understand what the issue is and why it is an issue. Some of our own people. And there's such a great need for people to understand one another, whether it's large countries or small countries in the world. No matter how big or how small you are, we all live on this planet. We all share our lives on this turtle island, we call it. And as a result, we're all here for a reason. And hopefully those reasons will be dealt with out of understanding and communication, in a way that benefits us all. And it sounds probably as though that's trite, and we all know that. But nonetheless, a lot of what happens to Native America is not done that way, in a way that allows us to be represented or at least understood. In referring to Indian Country, you're talking about hundreds and hundreds of groups of people. How do you speak to that many different cultures and groups? Well, we just wanted to be a vehicle to allow themselves to represent themselves. I wouldn't try to even suggest that I represent Indian Country or that our paper did, other than through the voices of Native peoples themselves. And that's really what we're trying to become. A conduit for their voice, for their representations, their stories, to be heard and told. But certainly it's complex and nuanced. And there's a great need to have that voice heard. That fire to continue to burn. And we will be doing everything we can to help make sure that happens in the future. There were some giant stories out of Indian Country this year that made national headlines. So what was your favorite story that didn't get a lot of press outside of ICTMN?  There were really so many. But I would say that the groundbreaking coverage, now spanning decades, on murdered and missing indigenous women, was incredibly significant, and still is. It was great to see [the movie] Wind River be created and produced, because it speaks to some of those issues certainly, and at the end talks about the fact that there's no statistics on murdered or missing native women, the way there are for other races. That's just sort of astonishing, some of the information. We've also done some really great stories that are interesting and fascinating about the intergenerational trauma that occurs — the latest studies on intergenerational trauma. We're tireless on our reporting on the Standing Rock Dakota Access Pipeline. Certainly, the interview with President Barack Obama was a wonderful opportunity. So they're just some of what I would say the more intriguing stories for a small publication like us. Are there any stories that you've been dying to do with Indian Country Today that you didn't get a chance to? I think no matter how much we would like certain stories to be done, it really is so important that a Native voice is heard. That the fire of the Native heart is able to be expressed in a way by Native people. And while it may not seem dramatically different than what else is happening, there is a difference. You can trust me, there is a difference. The critical issue to me, for Native America, I mean, they have highest teenage suicide rate in the world on Indian reservations. And that comes from, to me, a lack of self-esteem. A lack of even having an understanding, or a perception, or an image about themselves to see any hope for the future. What a hopeless statistic that is. And it is a statistic that says something very complex about our society, and about our problems that we have. And who in the country really is delving into that and addressing that issue? We're definitely not post-racial. And we like things complicated. For more on who we are, look here. Don't know what it means to ""code-switch,"" this will help.

npr,"September 23, 2017",Who Put The 'Hispanic' In Hispanic Heritage Month?," Día de la Raza marks Christopher Columbus' landfall in the Caribbean, and is celebrated in various Latin American countries as the start of the ""hispanicization"" of the ""new world."" (Though it seems weird to me that the month spans both September AND October to include a day many believe marks the beginning of the rape, pillage and genocide that began with Columbus' voyage. But, I digress.) Now, the whole notion that those of us from the Latin American diaspora refer to ourselves as 'Hispanic' or 'Latino' or 'Latinx' — that's pretty new. And, it's something we discussed on the podcast with Cristina Mora, a sociologist at the University of California, Berkeley. Mora wrote about the adoption of the term ""Hispanic"" and how the U.S. census played a big role. So, for ""Hispanic Heritage Month,"" here's the Q&amp;A; we did with Mora about her book, Making Hispanics: How Activists, Bureaucrats, and Media Created a New American, edited for length and clarity. ¡Disfrútalo! Hispanic, Latino, Latinx — these terms are all used to group Americans from the Latin-American diaspora together. But you write that in the 1960s, the three largest Latin American diaspora groups — Mexicans, Puerto Ricans and Cubans — didn't really want to be grouped together. Why is that? Oh, the issue was really contentious. On the one hand, you had Puerto Ricans, unsure of whether an alliance with Mexican-Americans would mean that their issues would be swept under the rug, because Mexicans were much larger. Mexican-Americans were in Texas, sometimes under Jim Crow restrictions, or in places like California, where they were segregated to different schools and discriminated against. Puerto Ricans had these sorts of issues, but were also really concerned about the Puerto Rican statehood question, and what rights they had as U.S. citizens. At the same time, these two groups had to contend with Cubans, many of whom claimed that they were white; many of whom saw themselves as not necessarily completely distinct from everyday Anglo-Americans in Florida. To the extent that [Cubans] were going to make demands on the state, it was to get the state to pay attention to Cuba. They were much less interested in making a demand based on minority rights. It just wasn't in their purview. There was no Hispanic option on that 1960 decennial census, right? No, not at all. There had been something called the Spanish surname count. And the Spanish surname count was a count that was only done in the Southwest. You would be labeled ""Spanish Surname"" if your name fell on this list that the U.S. Census Bureau had comprised of thousands of names culled from the Mexico City and the San Juan phone book. But once again, that was only if you lived in states like Texas, California, New Mexico and Colorado. How did that change on the next census? In the 1970 count, on the long form, which only select households were given, there was a question that asked, 'Are you of Spanish origin?' There, people could mark off 'yes,' and then write in whatever nationality they were. They were on the road towards creating a category that would indicate some sort of umbrella, pan-ethnic grouping that wasn't necessarily tied to a practice, like the practice of speaking Spanish, or to some objective factor, like what your last name was. But is it putting too fine a point on it to say that it was a total failure? That the 1970 census count really upset what we're calling the Latinx community, these days? From the standpoint of the count, sure. There was a huge undercount, just as there was an undercount of African-Americans. And the Latino community and their organizations, from the Mexican-American Legal Defense and Education Fund to ASPIRA and other Puerto Rican groups, took to writing to U.S. newspapers — The Wall Street Journal, New York Times, Washington Post — assailing the U.S. Census Bureau for not adequately counting them. In part, because they had this one select question that went to only 10 percent of households in the United States, and it wasn't in Spanish. And, they hadn't really mobilized a publicity campaign to actually teach people, 'Hey, there's this question that's about you that's incredibly important, that's going to be connected to political representation and all the ways that we see you.' And then by 1980, the term Hispanic shows up for the first time on a census form. How did that happen? One wouldn't necessarily think of [President Richard] Nixon as a champion of Latino rights or Latino identity. But he was open to hearing Latino concerns, in part because he grew up in Southern California, in a context where he knew Mexican-Americans existed. And they were different. Their lives were different; their experiences were different from whites. In 1972, he created the first comprehensive 'Hispanic vote' political campaigns at the presidential level that the country had ever seen. Nixon had what he called ""amigo buses"" that roamed around the Southwest but also the Northeast and into Florida. Those that roamed on the East Coast played salsa and cumbia and those that roamed in the Southwest played mariachi. This was before the Democratic Party did anything close to this. And the Nixon administration also pressured the Census Bureau to create an advisory board comprised of the Mexicans and the Puerto Ricans, who were incredibly loud, and also some Cuban sympathizers that had been big contributors to Nixon. One of the biggest points of debate is: What would this group be called on the census? How did they choose the term 'Hispanic'? Some of the advisory members said, ""Hey, why not use 'brown'? We don't fit into these white, black, Asian categories. That's not us."" Now, if you're a demographer, if you're a statistician, that seems like an incredible nightmare. You know, brown can mean Filipinos. Brown can be Native Americans. Brown can be South Asian Indians. This was a complete non-starter. They went down the list. Latin American. One of the problems is that Latinos were seen as foreigners, invaders and not inherently American. And one of the jobs of the advisory board was to really show that Latinos were an American minority group, like African-Americans — a minority that stretched from coast to coast and that were patriotic, that fought in wars, that contributed to American history, that built American cities. So when a term like Latin American was used, right away, it seemed to strike discord because it was seen as too foreign. Hispanic was never a term that everybody loved, but it was a term that got a lot of support from within Latinos in the Nixon and, later, the Ford administration. And, then, how did they make it stick? The Census director called all the Latino advocacy groups that were being set up in Washington, D.C. — the National Council of La Raza; the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund, and said: ""HELP."" NCLR set up town halls in places like Miami, New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, showing people the new census form and telling them, ""Look, we're Hispanic. This is us. This is our chance. This is our category!"" The second phone the Census director picked up was to Spanish-language media. At that time, the company that would later go on to be called Univision was growing rapidly. They ran documentaries, commercials, even a day-long telethon, where different performers from across Latin America came out. Each of them held out the census form and says, ""Hey, remember to fill out the census. We're Hispanic on the 1980 census. This is important for us."" How did we get from arguing for totally separate identities like Mexican, Puerto Rican and Cuban, to me calling myself a Latina? Because it takes on a life of its own! Once the category was made, everything from political groups to civic organizations to every other media group that would emerge, would draw on census data. As soon as the census numbers came out, Latino lobby groups could then run the numbers and say, 'Look, this is what Latino poverty looks like; this is what Latino educational attainment looks like.' They could go up to the Department of Education, for example, and say, ""Latinos are the second-largest minority group. And yet, our educational attainment pales to that of whites. Send money to our schools."" The same exact thing happened in the market. As soon as the numbers came out, Univision releases the first Hispanic marketing manual, in which they take figures like income, and they call it ""Hispanic buying power."" And they take the census report and make pitches to McDonald's and Kellogg's and everybody else. And they start to slowly grow. During the 1980s, Latino political organizations started to demand that not only should we have a Hispanic category in the census, but we damn well should have it on birth certificates. Michigan, Georgia, Louisiana — they still categorize Latinos as whites. And there was a large political push among these groups, with even Spanish-language media writing to them and saying, 'Look, put us down as Latinos. We're not white. We're distinct. We're different.' We're definitely not post-racial. And we like things complicated. For more on who we are, look here. Don't know what it means to ""code-switch,"" this will help.

 Andrea Unsworth, Sunshine Lencho, Nina Parks and Amber Senter. In 2015, they started an organization called Supernova Women, which offers free educational seminars to locals who are interested in the weed business. They talk about how they managed to break into the industry, as well as some of the pitfalls. And, in the spirit of consciousness-raising, they've created a safe space where prospective entrepreneurs can talk about what it feels like to be the only person of color in a mostly white space. ""Supernovas are a quiet force in the universe,"" Senter says. ""Things gravitate towards supernovas, and we saw all of us coming together as just being this huge force that could not be ignored. Because the issues that we were facing could not be ignored."" For our podcast episode this week, we spoke with Amber Senter and Andrea Unsworth about Supernova Women and about the challenges they've faced in an industry run predominantly by white people. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity. What are the barriers of entry for people of color trying to operate a successful weed business? Senter: Our skin color, obviously, because people don't have to give us anything because of that. I mean, not only am I black, but I'm also a woman. Two levels of barriers there. Convincing someone to give you $250,000 so you can start a business, that's challenging in itself. Even with all the experience that might be bringing to the table, you're still going to get doubted. Whereas if I were a white man, coming up with some corny idea — people are just throwing money at them. You know? And then there's other people who have proven product, made a million dollars in sales on their own, and are having problems raising $100,000, because they're people of color, women of color in the industry. We deal with the same barriers that would exist in any industry, and then it's compounded because we're talking about a federally illegal substance. You say it can be really hard, as a manufacturer, to go into a dispensary and talk to the buyer, because the buyer is a often a white guy. Can you break down that dynamic? Senter: First of all, when you're walking up to the dispensary, the people of color that are working in the dispensary are either going to be the security crew or the bud tenders, but none of the management. No one that's making any decisions. But that's how the whole industry currently is. Me, as a manufacturer looking for investment — there's no people of color investors. I mean they're out there, but they're hard to find. Unsworth: At the end of the day, we've been locking up people of color for 30 years, who have been selling cannabis. Now that it's legal, they say, ""Great, it's legal, but you have to have a million dollars to start."" Well, how can you have a million dollars if, for the past 30 years, you and all your relatives have been getting locked up and trying to spend that money on bail money? And raising your family without a father, without an uncle, without a son? Those are the realities. This whole thing of starting on a level playing field is ridiculous. [Nearly] 80 percent of the lock-ups are people of color. You're locking up all of these people who are trying to be entrepreneurs, but now that it's legal, you're allowed to say, ""Oh, you can come into our industry, but you can't have a criminal record. You can have a million dollars, but it can't be from cannabis, it has to be from your 401(k), or investments, or from your daddy."" I mean, who are these people? These are not people of color. On the site for Supernova Women, it says you want to foster a space for hard conversations. What type of hard conversations are y'all having?  Senter: I'm a manufacturer. We make cannabis products that we turn around and sell to dispensaries. And often times going into the dispensary, I have to deal with people that do not look like me. Typically white males. And I've got to convince them to first hear me out, and then try my product and then, if they think the product is good enough, to get it on their shelves. With the cultural differences and everything, these things are a fine dance, and a lot of people feel uncomfortable when you bring up these kinds of situations and things that we deal with. And I'm saying a lot of people — it's white folks. You know, they don't want to hear these things. So we create a safe space where we can discuss these issues and real-life things that we deal with daily. Unsworth: And I would say that those are the type of conversations that prompted things like the Oakland Equity Program, because that was not even on the table when we were first talking about cannabis. At least we need to recognize that there has been an unfair — an unjust war — on people of color that has had an impact over the past 20 to 30 years, that has kept them out of the cannabis industry that is now burgeoning. And so if we're going to have folks coming into the cannabis industry, we have to at least acknowledge that there has been demonstrable damage done to a lot of these communities that would love to be entrepreneurs that should have been some of the first in line. Because they've had innovative products and they've had the network, and they've had the skill to distribute cannabis for years, but were maybe locked up or put behind bars or just, you know, didn't have enough. We're definitely not post-racial. And we like things complicated. For more on who we are, look here. Don't know what it means to ""code-switch,"" this will help.

npr,"September 20, 2017","Black, Jewish And Avoiding The Synagogue On The High Holy Days"," You got a great deal on plane tickets? Reminds me of the time I took a free Birthright trip to Israel. Going skating? I haven't been on skates since my bat mitzvah reception, held at the roller skating rink in Villanova, Pa. You say you love the musicals of George Gershwin? Ha, that sounds just like Gershenfeld, my mother's maiden name, which is also my middle name, which means ""barley field"" in Yiddish, the language my ancestors spoke in Eastern Europe. Some of this is just me being obnoxious. But it's also a way to claim a part of my identity that's hidden from most people. I'm a black woman. No one ever assumes I'm Jewish. When I talk about Judaism, people look at me in a way that makes me feel like I'm breaking into my own house. Especially the people inside the house. As an invisible Jewish woman, I've been subjected to a lot of comments that I don't think I would hear otherwise. I had a friend in college who would reference how much the financial aid office was ""Jewing"" her. A colleague once described an actor as ""cute, but with a Jew nose."" A classmate complained that he was getting crowded out of law school by ""the Jews."" In those moments, I want to remind everyone that those are my people they're talking about. My so-called stingy, big-nosed, overbearing people. If you're talking about them, you're talking about me. But it's one thing when goyim don't recognize my faith. It's a different level of sadness when it comes from other Jews. I think back to that last time I was in a synagogue, in September 2014. It was a Shabbat service for prospective members at a reform temple in Philadelphia, two weeks before Rosh Hashanah. As with every new year, I was re-evaluating my life. When I talk about Judaism, people look at me in a way that makes me feel like I'm breaking into my own house. Especially the people inside the house. What the hell am I doing here? I thought. The question was both literal and existential. I'd gone to the synagogue with my boyfriend, who is white, Catholic, has a Jewish father, and grew up in a Jewish neighborhood in suburban New Jersey, which is to say he knows his way around a shul. As soon as we walked in, I started feeling like an accessory. This was a superprogressive synagogue, and I wasn't the only person of color in the congregation. But the way people greeted him first, always; the way someone explained to me what to expect of the service (It will be an hour long with portions in Hebrew and English); the way an usher smiled and asked me, not my boyfriend, What brings you here? Those moments made me want to scream, I'm one of you! When the service started, I was the one singing too loudly, and the first to stand every time the rabbi said, ""Please rise."" After it ended, I found myself aggressively kissing strangers on the cheek, practically shouting ""Shabbat shalom"" at women in cardigans who tried not to make eye contact. I stayed around to introduce myself to the rabbis, told them I'd been looking to join a synagogue for months. I promised I'd be back soon, for the High Holy Days. But I knew I wouldn't go back for Rosh Hashanah or Yom Kippur. I knew I wouldn't go back at all. I was already dreading the thought of doing it again, having to face those saccharine smiles trying to understand, Why are you here? Again, I'm a black woman with a Jewish mother, and I live in the United States of America. When I say that I'm used to being in places where I don't look like I belong, I mean it. Looking out of place is one of the most consistent parts of my life. But it's different in a synagogue. There's something about feeling like an outsider in the place where you grew up that stings. Like family members who no longer recognize you. It wasn't always like that. As a kid I could be black and Jewish and it wasn't a big deal. Sometimes people at my synagogue would raise an eyebrow at my brown skin, but when that happened, it was obvious they were the newbie, not me. I miss the synagogue of my youth, with the rabbi who'd pinch my cheeks and say shayna punim, and the opera singer-cum-cantor who would go nuts on the V'ahavta. I used to go to Hebrew school, Sunday school, Shabbat services, Purim parades. Once a month, I'd sit in the multipurpose room with my parents and make Jewish crafts. My mom was once the vice president in charge of social action on the synagogue's board of trustees. I brought tzedakah each week, I knew the prayers, I had friends, I had enemies, I had a carpool. I wasn't just passively part of that community because my ancestors lived through a pogrom. I helped create the community. And at a certain point, I stopped going. Mostly because I didn't have to. But when I tried to go back in college and beyond, I'd meet people who thought they needed to explain my faith to me. Now, without everyday ties to Judaism, I find myself fighting for it, even as I avoid the hard stuff, like taking the time to join a synagogue, getting to know people again, suffering through those awkward explanations. The longer I stay away, the less I feel like I belong. How long is it before I have to stop claiming that those are my people, especially when they don't claim me? That's the hardest part about not looking like I'm Jewish. I feel like if I'm not careful, eventually that part of me will fade away.

npr,"September 19, 2017",Starting School At The University That Enslaved Her Ancestors," Melisande Short-Colomb, 63, is a descendant of slaves sold by the Jesuits to fund Georgetown University. She's enrolled as a freshman there and plans to major in African-American studies. Mélisande Short-Colomb knew her family had been enslaved. But until recently, she didn't know that they were enslaved, and later sold, by Georgetown University. She found out about that part of her history when she got a message from a genealogist for the Georgetown Memory Project, which is dedicated to finding the descendents of the 272 people sold by the university in 1838. That, Short-Colomb says, ""was an 'Oh, my God!' moment."" And it led to a big life decision: She filled out an application to Georgetown and got accepted. This fall, at age 63, she's enrolled as a freshman. ""The mountain doesn't come to you,"" she says. ""You go to the mountain."" She's moved from her native Louisiana to the university's Washington, D.C., campus, where she plans to major in African-American studies. Below are highlights from Short-Colomb's interview with Mary Louise Kelly, of NPR's Morning Edition: On learning that her ancestors were enslaved by Georgetown: I was sad, I was hurt, I was angry. Which is something that I am all of the time, for all of my life, as a black American child born in 1954. What is happening here should not be a surprise. This isn't an 'aha' moment. This is history. And this is a part of our American story that we don't talk about. It's the difficult conversation we refuse to have. On how her enrollment at Georgetown affects its legacy of slavery: I don't think my being there actually starts to set things right. That's really not what's happening here. And I don't think we should misunderstand that. I made an application and was accepted as a qualified individual to attend Georgetown University. I had to apply like everybody else. I have student loans. I have a scholarship. I have a Pell Grant. I have work study. I have all of those things that go into being a student, and being a somewhat disadvantaged student. On telling her kids about her decision: I have four adult children and two grandchildren. My baby is 32. My oldest daughter is 38. I used to tell them all the time when they were growing up, ""When you are adults you're going to have to call one another to see where I am."" I am not the hovering, helicopter, have-a-grandchild-so-I-can-have-something-to-do-with-my-life mom. I'm the mom who's gotta work until she dies. I stayed at home, I was a stay-at-home mom for 12 years. Then I went to culinary school. I worked for 22 years as a professional culinarian, from line cook to executive chef. That's work that, physically, I can't do any more. And I'm not a sit-at-a-desk sort of person. And that was not my skill set. So every time I have needed to magnify my own skill set, the logical thing to do was to go to school, and improve my skill set. So this is a typical thing for me to do. On living on a campus that her ancestors helped build: I feel good about it. And I feel like we, who are descendants on campus now — there are three of us on campus — I feel like we are the dreams of our ancestors realized. We are prayers that are answered. We are 180 years in the future, of people who were terrified. On some day in 1838, when their lives were dramatically changed. And it's taken that long for us to talk about it.

npr,"September 17, 2017",What's In A (Hispanic-Sounding) Surname? We Gave Our Advice. Here's Yours," Remember Katie? She is the woman from Delaware who is thinking about getting married, but her boyfriend doesn't want her to take his last name. ""He was strongly against it,"" she wrote. ""He doesn't want an obviously Latino surname (think: Lopez or Garcia) to affect me negatively."" Well, Katie's question, and our answer last week, drew a lot of responses. We heard from people all over the country who've been in similar situations. Some agreed with us, some didn't. And while no one had a perfect solution, they all gave us a lot to think about. Here are excerpts from some of the best responses: Charla Grenz Solheim, 41, from Portland, Ore., has been in an interracial relationship for 15 years. She says that at the end of the day, it's up to Katie to ask herself some hard questions: Is it worth causing issues or stress for her partner? Probably not. Would it be instructive to her as a social experiment, and does she feel capable to handle whatever issues may arise because of her decision to change her name? Does her partner really NOT want her to change her name, or does he simply want to educate her on the risks involved? My general stance is: What's the real thing you're discussing? Does he just worry in general about disadvantaging you? Are you just trying to simplify your name/life or do you really feel strongly about taking his last name as a show of solidarity or tradition or whatever? In my experience, getting to the root of the thing is more efficient than the surface-level arguments about them. Daniel Ignacio Headley, 41, is from Albuquerque, N.M., and was born in Mexico. He started out life as Ignacio Perches but agreed to have his name changed at age 5, when his Mexican mother married a white American: I had no idea then that this would confuse people for the rest of my life. Now, I am a 41-year-old Latino, 100 percent Mexican origin (whatever that means), naturalized U.S. citizen, native Spanish speaker, married to a blond-haired woman with blue eyes, and we share my English last name. My wife would tell you that she has experienced some awkward, and even painful, situations since marrying me. People often think that, since she has an English last name and she is clearly a white person, she is a safe person to complain with about the presence of Latinos in our country. She is not. We are passionate about the plight of the foreigners among us, including Latinos, and we aren't afraid to lovingly, yet firmly, educate people on the subject. So, in some ways, having an English last name has resulted in my wife hearing more ugly comments, not less. As for how a Latino person with an English name is perceived, I can say that is often weird, too. I can't tell you how many times I've had to explain why my last name is Headley, because at first glance, it is clear that I am not English. As a result, white people and Hispanic people are confused about where I come from. Am I one of them, or not? Am I safe? Am I on their side? This is the problem and why we are having this discussion. One of our suggestions for Katie was that her partner consider taking her last name: ""Then, you would both share a name, and next time he is sending out his résumé, he might get a taste of that white privilege himself."" Not so fast, says Catherine Rock, 26, of Dallas. She warns that Katie and her boyfriend should think twice before taking that route: My husband and I decided to take my last name, rather than his, and in Texas at least, it's a much more drawn-out and expensive process to change the man's name. I could have just danced in and out of the courthouse with the marriage license, but my husband has had to file a legal petition, get his fingerprints run and set a court date to go before a judge to get permission to change his. All totaled, we're out about 300 bucks more than we would be if it was my name changing, and we're in the third month of the process. It's frustrating, and more than a bit draconian. I am confident it wouldn't be such an issue if more couples made this choice. So the gender inequality continues. Loren Hadzimuratovic, 32, in Washington, D.C., says she was nine months into a marriage where she took her husband's ""very 'foreign' name."" The experience has been an eye-opener: Quick background: I am a white woman from North Carolina. My husband, on the other hand, is a Muslim refugee who came here as a teenager fleeing a civil war. He is also tall, blond, with blue-green eyes. His first name is an Arabic name, but easily passes, both in pronunciation and writing, as a name in America that no one thinks twice about. The only place in which my husband does not ""pass"" is his very long, difficult to pronounce, Islamic last name, which is now my last name as well. What I noticed in the conversation with Katie was a lot of the discussion rotating around her possibly losing privilege or not getting what it would be like to have a name that people judge. From my own perspective, the loss of privilege hasn't happened (as much as I can tell), but that has been entirely at my husband's expense: People we interact with work incredibly hard to ensure that I keep my privilege as ""a real American"" by commenting on the sacrifice I've made to take such a weird name. For example: Every single hotel or airport we walk into has included someone looking at our names quickly looking at me to ask if this is my married name and then saying, ""Wow, you must really love him to take THAT name."" On my own, people really want to know if this is my ""real"" name or just my ""married"" name, and the look of comfort that comes when I answer that it's my married name is beyond disconcerting. They insist on comparing me versus him, upholding my status as ""normal."" It bothers them that we seem so ""American,"" and yet that name clearly indicates that SOMETHING is amiss, and they truly will not stop until they understand who the foreigner is. Changing my name opened up a new vulnerability for my husband, who has frankly worked so hard to pass and excel in a very white professional world. It's possible that Katie's partner doesn't want to open up yet another avenue of attack, made even more uncomfortable and deeply personal by it being linked to the woman he loves. I'm not saying people shouldn't change their name. But I will readily admit that I saw a name change as only something that impacted me and never occurred to me that society's reaction would work so hard to point out that HE is the different one who caused this, whose foreign-ness I tolerate because of my love for him. And let's give the last word to Cyndi Castle, 27, from Dallas. She is Mexican-American and recently married a white man. Cyndi understands Katie's dilemma — she grew up proud of her Mexican name, and it's a big part of her heritage. But she also sees things from the viewpoint of Katie's boyfriend: When we first discussed marriage and got engaged, changing my name was a fairly out-of-the-question and difficult topic for me. I'm proud of my heritage. In many ways, my name is one of the only distinguishing factors of my heritage. [But] I knew changing my name was important to my husband, so I slowly considered hyphenating for him. Then election season began to gear up. I changed my mind. A portion of me did decide to change my name out of fear. It's a reality and one I struggle with daily. But another portion did it because I remembered those early years of life — feeling different and alone. I didn't want to do that to my future children. A portion of me did it because I remember when a group of people I thought were my friends told me I only got into the college I wanted and got a scholarship because I was Latinx. Not because I had straight A's, great test scores or was a National Merit Scholar. And these were supposed to be my friends. I couldn't expose my future children to that devastation and that form of racism which can, and very well seems to be, getting worse. I wanted to spare them the looks in job interviews. The comments, ""You're not what we expected."" I'm changing my name. It still hurts me to say it. I feel like I'm mourning. I feel like I've lost a part of myself. That I'm going to have to work even harder to show my identity. That I'll just blend in. It's what I wanted, given the situation. But I don't enjoy it. I'll give my children Latinx identities in other ways. I'll encourage them to be proud of their heritage and culture. To enjoy salsa dancing and the music that I grew up with. I'll make sure their grandparents teach them Spanish, and that they'll visit Mexico and see their roots. But they won't have my name. Need your own racial advice?

npr,"September 7, 2017",'His Ideology Is White Supremacy': Ta-Nehisi Coates On Donald Trump," Over the course of his presidency, many have tried to explain Donald Trump's ideology as a rejection of globalization, or the ""political establishment."" Political pundits on both the left and the right have talked about economic anxieties and regional values as motivating Trump's election. But for Ta-Nehisi Coates, it all comes down to race. ""[Trump's] ideology is white supremacy, in all its truculent and sanctimonious power,"" Coates writes in an essay for The Atlantic, adapted from his upcoming book, We Were Eight Years in Power: An American Tragedy. Coates spoke to Rachel Martin of Morning Edition about that essay, which will be featured in the Atlantic's October issue. The conversation focuses on why Coates thinks that Trump's election was a direct response to having a black man occupy an office that was, up until Barack Obama, ""reserved for white men.""  The interview has been edited and condensed. You don't buy the argument that Donald Trump's election was about the white working class in America feeling marginalized from a globalized workforce, from a globalized economy that had left them behind — and that that's what was animating that demographic. Well, you know, it's certainly true that the white working class feels that way. But anybody who wants to make a class-based argument must explain why the black working class, the Latino working class, didn't break the same way. They are just as afflicted by forces of globalization and economic change, deindustrialization, et cetera. And yet they didn't break to Trump. The other thing that has to be explained is why Trump was dominant across nearly every socio-economic sector of white America. It was not simply that he rose on the strength of the white working class. He rose on the strength of all of white America. Some people look at those sectors that you just talked about and say, ""Well, they weren't motivated by race in this"" or ""They were OK electing and supporting a presidential candidate, whom many believe was propagating racist policies."" Weren't they just voting on their interests, which do not include race relations in this country? Yeah. I would definitely agree with that. And I would argue, I think there's something behind even saying that ""race relations"" aren't their interest. I think that's a statement itself. Race relations are interested in them, whether they're interested in it or not. Well, I guess that's what I'm pointing out, is that race would be something that would be more at the forefront of the people who are being marginalized by what are called ""racist policies,"" and so maybe that's a problem. But it is the world we live in that whites don't recognize racism in this country as something that would be an animating force in their electoral decisions. I would agree with that. I would just add that I don't think that's exonerating. For instance, I think if you say, ""Well yeah, Donald Trump ran a racist campaign, but I voted for him despite that,"" that is to say that having somebody who runs that type of campaign is not a disqualifier to you. You don't let anyone off the hook in this piece. You and I have talked before about how you think even President Obama, to a degree, downplayed racial divides and talked instead about economic injustices that face all Americans regardless of race. But you also in this piece call out Bernie Sanders, and to a lesser degree Hillary Clinton, for doing the same thing. You believe the political left in this country is also complicit. I do. I think there is a long tradition in this country of evasion. I mean, David Duke, a former Klansman who was running for office in Louisiana, was very, very successful. And folks say they say the exact same thing about that, that they say today: ""Oh, it's economic distress."" Clearly a lot of people here felt left behind economically. That's why folks were so moved to be represented by a Klansman. And there's a broad agreement, I would say, across the Democratic Party from folks who are more centrist like Obama and Clinton, and folks who are further left like Bernie Sanders, that the real issue is actually economics — that there isn't some bastion of racism to be found in the white working class. And I don't think there's a particular one to be found in a white working class. I think there's a particular one to be found in white America in general. So you've outlined a situation in which there don't seem to be any saviors. No existing party or movement that gets us out of this situation to rescue us, essentially, from the racial divides that seem to be deepening. That is a sad indictment. How do you — because it is human nature to try to look toward some kind of light — where do you see the light? Where do you see a moment, or a way out? I don't think I do. We have some you know some 400 years of history weighing down on us, going all the way back to colonial times when black folks first arrived here in 1619. We have not figured out a way to really pay down that debt to get that history up off of us. And so I think the expectation at some moment will happen now is, forgive me, a bit naive. How do you raise kids in that? I mean you've written an entire book dedicated to your son addressing this very issue; but how do you — I mean when the future is that bleak when the present and the future are that bleak? I think quite easily. Life is always a problem. The fact that I'm on the radio saying that I don't necessarily see hope does not relieve people, does not relieve my son, does not relieve children, of the responsibility to struggle. Folks struggled in much bleaker times than this. So to me, the answer to that is the same answer to how we got here in the first place. It's history. If you look at how human beings have been throughout history, during bleak times, they've struggled. Why would it be any different this time? We're definitely not post-racial. And we like things complicated. For more on who we are, look here. Don't know what it means to ""code-switch,"" this will help.

npr,"September 8, 2017","Using Black Celebrities To Push Pop, Pudding And Politics"," We take black mega-celebrity endorsers as a given today: Michael Jordan, Oprah Winfrey, Beyonce, the husk that was once Tiger Woods. They wield a kind of agency that seems to continually reset the upper limits of black aspiration, while remaining more or less incidental to the median black condition. It wasn't always so. There was a moment in the 1960s, for example, when the Supremes were one of the biggest acts in show business, with a string of Top 10 hits. But the trio weren't making a lot of money endorsing products made by big companies — or, at least, not endorsing those products to ""mainstream"" (read: white) audiences. According to Tom Burrell, the pioneering ad executive and the subject of the latest Code Switch podcast, Coca-Cola would only placed ads featuring the Supremes on black radio, so worried was the soft drink giant that the trio might scandalize white consumers

 Tom Burrell, ad man. That line of reasoning held sway for a long time, until people like Tom Burrell helped dislodge it. Burrell one of the very first black men in advertising, and his hire for a job in an agency's mailroom was considered so risky that the company's CEO had to be called in from vacation to sign off on it. And because Burrell was a black man climbing the corporate ladder in the 1960s, he saw his work as part of a larger project. Burrell understood, too, that he wasn't just selling burgers for McDonald's, but politics: His ad campaigns were always informed by his belief that they should portray black folks in the most affirming light. Today we call this ""respectability politics,"" the practice of using ""positive"" portrayals to counter unflattering stereotypes as a way to further racial equality. There are lots of valid critiques of this line of thought — is discrimination against black people who are less ""respectable"" somehow more justified? — but it was in step with the mores held by many folks of that era. It's the reason so many images of the civil rights movement show protesters in dresses and crisp shirts and ties — their appearances beyond reproach. It was a media play, by activists, for the hearts and minds of the broader public. Sonari Glinton, a business correspondent at NPR, brought us Burrell's story. He says Burrell changed how advertisers thought about who they could sell to, and who their audiences might buy from. Burrell's agency found that white audiences responded more positively to ads with black actors and celebrities targeted to black people than they did to ads aimed at white consumers. (Make of the implications there what you will.) As Sonari and I talked, we couldn't help but note the odd coincidence that the first shining exemplars of the crossover black pitchman — O.J. Simpson and Bill Cosby — are today seen by an awful lot of folks as supervillains. ""O.J. was the first to demonstrate that white folks would buy stuff based on a black endorsement — as long as it was not pressed as a black endorsement,"" said Harry Edwards, a sociologist at the University of California, Berkeley, during the Oscar-winning documentary, O.J.: Made In America. A key to understanding the robust support those two men still enjoy in some places is remembering that their particular celebrity always carried a different gravity than that of their white contemporaries — regardless of whether they personally leaned into it. Simpson famously avoided speaking out on racial issues, and Ezra Edelman, the director of OJ: Made in America, told us last fall that those famous Hertz commercials featuring Simpson were cast so that he was the only black person in them. It was never just Pudding Pops, then, but politics: Simpson and Cosby became famous when being black and on America's TV sets was still a novel and subversive notion, even a dangerous one. That doesn't, and shouldn't, make those men any more sympathetic. But it might shed light on the people who still vocally defend them; they were not only selling products but a seductive vision of a black America not weighted down by American racism. A black celebrity accused of the same crimes but who rose to prominence at a later time — a time with different politics around race and gender — might not enjoy the same tortured benefit of the doubt. (When Burrell, a generational contemporary of those two, was asked in 2014 what he made of the avalanche of sexual assault accusations against Cosby, he offered up a politician's non-statement: ""It's sad if it's true, and it's sad if it's not."") The squeamishness about black pitchmen as the face of ""mainstream"" ad campaigns lingered even after Burrell (and yes, Cosby and Simpson) terraformed the marketing landscape. Decades after the Supremes' heyday, in the Cola wars of the 1980s, Coca-Cola offered Michael Jackson — by then, on his way to becoming the biggest and most ubiquitous celebrity in the world — a $1-million dollar endorsement deal. But it envisioned a ""targeted, ethnic campaign,"" recalled Jay Coleman, a businessman involved in the negotiations, told Billboard in 2009. Jackson passed, and instead, inked a then-record endorsement deal with the competition: Pepsi. That deal spawned Pepsi's inescapable ""New Generation"" campaign that ran for nearly a decade on primetime network TV; Pepsi's sales and market share climbed. Meanwhile, Coke's position fell, all while being implicitly cast as the preferred soft drink of out-of-touch fogeys and not the ""new generation."" The campaign also served as an inflection point, the moment in which it became clear that corporations might benefit more from their proximity to a black star than the other way around. And it also, perhaps, presaged the world on the horizon, where the influence of those stars would become at once more pronounced and less inherently charged. America has gotten pretty used to ubiquitous black celebrity, even as it's still trying to figure out what to make of black folks, broadly. We're definitely not post-racial. And we like things complicated. For more on who we are, look here. Don't know what it means to ""code-switch,"" this will help.

Preserving It May Be Just As Hard," It was the early 1940s, when 12-year-old Charles ""Bob"" Martin, a Washington, D.C., kid who had always loved the water, decided to try to rent a boat. So he headed down to the waterfront to ask about the cost. A white man working there told him it would cost $5 to reserve a rowboat, plus a quarter for every hour on the water. The next week Martin headed back to the waterfront with money he'd cobbled together from his job at a local pharmacy. He saw the same man with the boats for rent. What happened next remains seared into his memory.

Around that same time, just upriver from where Martin was turned away, Lewis T. Green, a shop teacher at a D.C. high school, was trying to create a boat club for himself and other black boaters in the city. Green asked federal officials for permission to use land for his fledgling group, but didn't have much luck. He eventually got the attention of the philanthropist Mary McLeod Bethune, who in turn contacted her friend, Eleanor Roosevelt, who was then-first lady of the United States. Soon enough, the Interior Department allowed Green the use of a small plot by the railroad tracks near the Anacostia River. It's where Seafarers Boat Club — now Seafarers Yacht Club — began and where it still stands. Bob Martin, the young boy who vowed to get himself a boat, would eventually take over as the commodore, or president, of that club in the mid-1960s.

Hall said to himself that if he ever got the money, he would become a ""captain,"" which is what Seafarers calls its members who own boats. It wasn't until around 2012 that he became a full member, with the help of his cousin, from whom Hall also received his boat, The Raven. In 2013, he called his Seafarers' membership ""a blessing from the man upstairs — it's a poor man's dream come true.""

""This is one of the most promising lands, blessed lands, in the city,"" Hall said. ""Natural resources, natural resources. It's off the chain in the summer. You catch a fish every five, 10 seconds. That's how many catfish out there. This catfish heaven."" Hall ran a plumbing, heating and cooling business and would often stop in at Seafarers between jobs. His evenings were often spent on The Raven, fishing for catfish. He spent Halloweens cooking out on the boat. He held his family's Thanksgiving oyster roast at the clubhouse. When his sister was killed, her repast was held at Seafarers. Even as Hall fought cancer, he spent time on his boat, until he eventually got too sick to make it to the docks. ""You can sit out here and read your books, and you can understand what's going on,"" Hall said. ""No distraction, you know? You gotta have that peace of mind. ... The rest will come. The rest will come. It's really peaceful out here ... until the train comes.""

 A quiet view of Anacostia River on a Monday evening after a heavy rain, which stirred up debris in the river. The Seafarers clubhouse and the Pennsylvania Avenue bridge appear in the distance. The Anacostia River is often called D.C.'s ""Forgotten River"" — shallower and tougher to navigate than the Potomac. It's historically polluted by industry waste, sediment, sewage and just plain garbage. For a long time, though, the Seafarers have thought of themselves as the Anacostia's stewards.

Right: Shamaari Pondexter, a mentee in the ""Just Say Yes"" program cleans up driftwood at the annual Earth Day clean up in 2016. Back in the mid-1980s, Howard Gasaway, a long-time captain and former commodore at Seafarers, was approached by then-mayor Marion Barry. ""Howard, why don't you clean up this river?"" the mayor asked. Gasaway's response: ""Mr. Mayor, it's not my river — It's your river."" But Gasaway took Barry's suggestion to heart, and corralled his fellow Seafarers to create the first Anacostia River Earth Day clean-up back in 1985. It's an event they've taken part in ever since.

In recent years, the much-maligned river has become more attractive to developers looking for new land near the city's waterfront. Luxury condos, event venues, and parks have been sprouting up all around Seafarers, which is attracting more new faces to the area. And all that new activity is encroaching on the club's tranquil, off-the-beaten-path vibe. Tony Ford, Seafarers' current commodore, knows this. Ford wants to make sure the organization remains accessible — and sustainable.

""I think the people before us made a mark here, so our time is to try to get this club stabilized,"" says Ford. ""The community of boaters is very tight, everybody down here kind of knows each other. If you don't know them by name, you know them by face,"" says Ford. ""The challenge that we're facing now is that we know that development is coming."" Ford hopes that nearby real estate developments and rising property values won't compromise some of Seafarers core values.

 James ""AJ"" Hall takes festival goers on electric boat tours of the Anacostia River as part of the first ever Anacostia River Festival in 2015. The area's continued development has brought more attention and more visitors to the river. ""The goal is to maintain what we call 'affordable boating,' but more importantly 'affordable boating' for minorities,"" says Ford. ""It's not just about black, it's not just about white, it's not just about Hispanic, but when I say minorities, [I mean] minorities on the economic scale."" Seafarers is also facing challenges — from Mother Nature and Father Time. The river adjacent to the club is silting in; as it becomes gradually shallower, it's impossible for bigger boats to enter and exit the dock except at high tide. ""The siltuation isn't going to stop, it's going to come to a point when it's real low tide some of these boats are literally sitting in mud,"" Ford says. That can ruin the engines of boats. Dredging the river might be one option, but it's a political long shot and could cost upward of $20 million. Some Seafarers think the condition of the river has discouraged new boaters from joining their ranks. At the same time, Ford wants the club to attract younger boaters to their tight-knit organization, as its current members get older.

""You have the Baby Boomers, Generation X-ers, that's pretty much who is here now,"" says Ford. ""The next generation is the Millennials. Because of all of the political things that we've had to go through trying to maintain down here, there's not been enough outreach to the Millennials the way that they need to be,"" he said. But Ford wants to teach these kids the Seafarers' way too, ""because we think that's just as important."" As the club steers through the uncertainty brought on by gentrification and the river's ecological challenges, some members would rather stay put at the club's historic location, where it's been for over half a century. But other members, who are generally younger, want the club to move downriver to a deeper, more navigable stretch of the Anacostia where they can take their boats out more easily.

The pillars of the old 11th street bridge are the proposed site of a future elevated park that's estimated to cost 45 million dollars.  Ford wants to split the difference — pursuing a temporary move while maintaining Seafarers' current spot, in the event that the nearby riverbed is dredged. That way, the Seafarers could ultimately return to the place that's been a sanctuary for working people in the area for seven decades.

npr,"October 29, 2017",Prize-Winning Photos Show A Different Side Of Instagram," At first glance, you see a young girl goofing around with her friends.  But there's one crucial detail: This girl — 16-year-old Nirma — has a traditional stripe of vermilion powder smudged into her forehead. In her region in India, that's a sign that means Nirma is married. Nirma is one of several young women that New Delhi-based photographer Saumya Khandelwal features in a series depicting the daily lives of child brides in Shravasti, India. ""In this part of India, there are villages where almost every girl over the age of 12 is married,"" Khandelwal says. ""And these girls are deprived of their dreams, of their innocence."" This week, her photographs won her one of the top spots in Getty Images third annual Instagram Grant. Khandelwal, along with American photographers Nina Robinson and Isadora Kosofsky, won $10,000 each for using Instagram as a platform to highlight stories of underrepresented people around the world.

npr,"October 28, 2017",Hepatitis A Outbreak Hits California," NICK YPHANTIDES: Literally power washing the streets with water and the bleach substance that neutralizes the virus, making bathrooms more accessible, putting literal mobile hand-washing stations in certain areas. And then we've passed out almost 8,000 sanitation kits. So a whole different approach than we typically do of waiting for people to come to us. BLOCK: And when you approach these populations and say, we're concerned you might be at risk - we'd like to vaccinate you against hepatitis A - how open have people been to that? YPHANTIDES: Unfortunately, we know that the homeless individuals who are unsheltered and living in the street are disproportionately burdened with behavioral health challenges, mental disease, substance abuse disorders. And so if a nurse from the government shows up with a syringe and says, hey, I'm here from the government. I'm here to help you. Take this shot - it's not so simple. We have had to spend a tremendous amount of time building trust, providing education and making the case for why receiving a vaccine is such a critical opportunity for them to protect their health. BLOCK: What are the symptoms of hepatitis A? YPHANTIDES: These are symptoms that basically reflect inflammation of the liver. And the most common symptoms are basically fever, fatigue, nausea and vomiting, significant abdominal pain, the loss of appetite. And then one of the telltale things is either darkening of the urine or what's called jaundice, which is the common yellowing of the eyes and the yellow hue of the skin, indicating liver enzymes being spilled into the bloodstream. So jaundice is also a very common symptom. BLOCK: Dr. Yphnatides, if you think long term about changes you would want to see made to prevent another outbreak like this in the future, where does that take you? YPHANTIDES: Well, you know, this hepatitis outbreak to me is, like, the ultimate example of social determinants of health. One of the worst social determinants to be struggling with is not having a place to live. It is my hope that we are going to come together - not just the San Diego County but the country at large - in terms of figuring out strategies where folks can have basic needs met so as to not be at risk disproportionately for infections such as this. BLOCK: That's Dr. Nick Yphantides. He is chief medical officer of San Diego County. Thanks so much for talking with us. YPHANTIDES: The pleasure is my own. Thank you.

npr,"October 28, 2017",Agnes Binagwaho Is A Doctor With 'Sassitude'," Years before she became the health minister of Rwanda, Agnès Binagwaho tried to lock a fellow pediatrician in a hospital room. She saw a doctor in an examining room with a mother who held her sick daughter in her arms. And he was asleep. When Binagwaho saw the scene, she was appalled. She examined the girl herself in a separate room and then asked the child to shut the door on the doctor, who wouldn't be able to get out without the nurse's key. The medical staff wasn't too pleased. ""They found me more guilty for trying to close him in that room for the night than him for mistreating the kid who could have died,"" she says. Throughout her life, Binagwaho — affectionately called ""Dr. Agnès"" by colleagues — has been unafraid to defy authority by speaking her mind. In the process, she has helped to transform Rwanda's health system. In 2015, she was given the $100,000 Roux Prize from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, cited for using data to improve the country's health care. When she found that a significant number of Rwandans were dying soon after birth, Binagwaho and her staff invested in equipment and training to bring down the number of neonatal deaths, a campaign that has seen success. She has used ""data to effectively and efficiently overcome Rwanda's health challenges,"" says Tom Achoki, IHME director of African initiatives. And now she's a movie star as well. Binagwaho appears in the new documentary Bending the Arc, about the groundbreaking methods Partners In Health uses to deliver health care. In the film, she definitely speaks her mind. At a meeting where questions are raised about allocating funds for health care in a poor community, she says bluntly, ""People are dying, brother."" ""She is both doing the work and holding this utopian goal in mind,"" says Dr. Paul Farmer, co-founder and chief strategist of Partners In Health, which delivers health services to poor countries, including some of Rwanda's most destitute villages. Farmer met Binagwaho at a U.N. General Assembly meeting on AIDS in 2001 and was immediately impressed by ""all her sassitude."" When a man made a sexist remark about Binagwaho during a delegation trip, she wryly informed the laughing crowd that she would prescribe him Viagra. She also fought to provide Rwandan girls with HPV vaccinations to lower their chances of getting cervical cancer by partnering with American pharmaceutical company Merck. About 93 percent of eligible girls were vaccinated; people in developing countries often wait years for vaccinations available in high-income countries. ""When I was a little mouse, I tried to make as much noise as a lion,"" she says. ""When I became stronger, I made less noise because the objective was to change. And sometimes to change, you better study and try to do it without screaming too much."" Binagwaho was born in Rwanda but her father moved the family to Belgium in 1958, when she was three years old, so that he could attend medical school. A year after they left, Rwanda's ""Wind of Destruction"" began — clashes between two ethnic groups that resulted in the deaths of thousands of Tutsis. She says her parents didn't teach her much about Rwandan culture, thinking she would never return. But it didn't matter. ""I always believed I was a Rwandan,"" she says. ""I had a sense of belonging but to what, I was searching."" She read books written by Rwandans and went to events with fellow Rwandans. In 1994 while in France, she watched news reports about 800,000 Rwandans who were murdered in 100 days. Two years after the genocide, she returned to the country. Her husband had lost half of his family and wanted to go back. She went — not knowing the national language of Kinyarwanda — and saw people so depressed that they stopped caring about life. ""Everything was destroyed. Even the morale of the people was destroyed. That means there was also no accountability — health professionals were careless and created a lot of damage. But even with the little we had, we could have done better."" Binagwaho's work helped turn the war-torn country around, says Farmer. She insisted that health — physical, mental and social — was a human right for all. That meant reaching people everywhere, regardless of their ethnic group, location or income. As a pediatrician, she saw children who were orphaned when their parents died of HIV. At the same time, some of her young patients were HIV positive. Rape was widespread during the war, and witnesses later reported that assailants announced their intention to infect women and girls with the virus. She believed in the importance of HIV treatment and prevention. Binagwaho went on to lead Rwanda's National AIDS Control Commission from 2002 to 2008. During her tenure, she and her team aimed to connect public, private and community sectors to provide better HIV care. During those years, HIV care improved. According to the U.N., the number of people dying from HIV each year fell from 15,000 to 7,700 — 44 percent in six years. New infections were cut in half. In 2008, Binagwaho began serving as permanent secretary in the Ministry of Health and was appointed its minister in 2011. To reach the country's poorest, the ministry trained 45,000 people as community health workers, sending them into the homes of people who often don't receive care. It also gave community workers cell phones that allowed patients to contact doctors through Twitter. By 2010, maternal mortality dropped more than 60 percent from the 1990 figure. Life expectancy rose from 28 years in 1994 to 56 years in 2012. Health insurance coverage is practically universal at more than 90 percent, and the poorest receive free care. Despite being one of the poorest countries in the world, Rwanda has one of the fastest growing economies in Central Africa. Binagwaho utters a line that feels worn down with use, directed at skeptics who question the validity of spending money on health care in developing countries: ""Health is key in development. It increases the GDP of the country. We seem just to spend money, but it's not true. Health equity is a business plan."" Despite her track record, she has faced controversy. In 2016, President Paul Kagame — who is both admired and accused of running a government that silences opposition — relieved her of her duties amid allegations of mismanagement of health resources. She defends her tenure by saying, ""I served from 2011 to 2016, longer than any other minister of health in Rwanda and the President decided it was time for a change. I'm proud of what the team I was leading has accomplished."" Binagwaho still lives in Kigali, Rwanda's capital. She's had more than 100 peer-reviewed articles published, including one in BMC Pediatrics on how Rwandan children with HIV often have depression and require better mental health care. She is a senior lecturer at Harvard and an adjunct professor at Dartmouth. And she's counting down the days until she moves north to rural Butaro, where she is buying a plot of land to live near her latest project. The University of Global Health Equity was dreamed up by Binagwaho, who serves as the university's vice chancellor, and two other humanitarian-physicians, including Paul Farmer and Dr. Peter Drobac. They want to train new generations of health-care workers to provide services in the poorest of communities. The initial $30 million funding came from the Cummings Foundation and the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation (which is a funder of NPR). Though the construction of the campus is not yet complete, the university has 46 students. The first 17 graduated with a Master of Science in global health delivery. Each two-year student receives partial financial aid for the $8,250 annual tuition. The latest batch of applicants come from 29 countries on four continents, according to John Urschel, director of the University's partnership development. Urschel describes them as people ""who are desperately looking for an alternative to the traditional idea of global health. These are activists who want to learn how to improve their communities, they want to learn how to marshal political will. They're in the field and they're frustrated with what they see."" Nothing makes Binagwaho angrier than ""unnecessary death."" She says she has watched too many people in the developing world die of treatable conditions just because they lack access to good health care. ""Equity is in the heart,"" she says. ""Meaning you always make sure to include everybody, leave nobody out."" The United States, says Binagwaho, has yet to learn that lesson. Her fervent desire to help everyone and to prioritize the most vulnerable echoes back to her earlier days as a pediatrician in neonatal care. ""All life is very precious, but the beginning is magic,"" says the mother of two daughters. ""You are a human being and you just come out of water, discover the world and you scream. For the majority of births on Earth, I think, it's a joy, this new life. It's a mission that each human has — protecting life, giving life, continuing life.""

npr,"October 27, 2017",Counting The Heavy Cost Of Care In The Age Of Opioids," As deaths from opioid overdoses rise around the country, the city of Baltimore feels the weight of the epidemic. ""I see the impact every single day,"" says Leana Wen, the city health commissioner. ""We have two people in our city dying from overdose every day."" As part of Baltimore's strategy to tackle the problem, Wen issued a blanket prescription for the opioid overdose drug naloxone, which often comes in a nasal spray, to all city residents in 2015. She says many deaths have been prevented by getting the drug into the hands of more people. But now, there's a problem: ""We're out of money for purchasing Narcan [a brand of naloxone]. We're having to ration this medication,"" Wen says. People can purchase Narcan at pharmacies on their own. As we've reported, it's now sold at all Walgreens. But at a cost of about $125 a pop, many people can't afford it. Thursday, the Trump administration declared the opioid crisis a public health emergency, but many critics say it doesn't go far enough when it comes to funding. Wen says she would like a commitment from the administration to help pay for this drug. She says the administration could also negotiate directly with manufacturers to lower the price of naloxone. ""We know treatment works, but we don't have [the] money,"" Wen says. Paying for rapid reversal drugs is certainly not the only challenge health officials face in tackling the opioid epidemic. A recent nationwide study published in the Annals of the American Thoracic Society points to a significant increase in the cost of treating overdose patients who are admitted to hospital intensive care units. 
                An overdose rescue kit handed out at an overdose prevention class this summer in New York City includes an injectable form of the drug naloxone.

 An overdose rescue kit handed out at an overdose prevention class this summer in New York City includes an injectable form of the drug naloxone. ""These are patients who have survived admission [to the hospital] and have significant complications from an overdose,"" says study author Jennifer Stevens, a critical care doctor at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. She says complications can include kidney failure and infection. Some patients require a ventilator during hospitalization to support breathing. Researchers analyzed billing data from more than 150 hospitals in 44 states, and they evaluated all the opioid-associated overdose admissions to ICUs between 2009 and 2015. The study found a 34 percent increase in overdose-related ICU admissions during that period. And costs rose by almost 60 percent. In 2009, the average cost of care per admission was about $58,000. By 2015, the cost had risen to about $92,000. In addition, the study points to almost a doubling of deaths among opioid overdose patients in hospital ICUs during the study period. ""It's a call to arms that everything we're doing is not enough,"" Stevens says. Stevens says she thinks a lot about the services patients may need once they're released from the hospital. ""They need long-term support,"" she says. Many experts say this must include expanded access to addiction treatment. ""The key to unlocking the opioid crisis is the availability of quality treatment beds,"" Gil Kerlikowske, a former drug policy adviser to President Obama, tells us in an email. ""We know treatment works and is far less expensive than jail or hospitalization."" Shots is the online channel for health stories from the NPR Science Desk.

npr,"October 27, 2017",How Consumers Could Be Affected If CVS And Aetna Merge," AMANDA STARC: Thanks for having me. MCEVERS: So most of us know CVS as, you know, the drugstore on the corner, right? Why are they interested in buying this big health insurance company? STARC: It turns out that your perception of CVS as the drugstore on the corner isn't quite right. So in practice, CVS provides a lot of drug insurance through something called a pharmacy benefits manager. And that's going to account actually for the majority of their revenue. So while you might think of them as the drugstore, they're ultimately a big insurance company. MCEVERS: So what would a merger like this then mean for CVS and then also just for customers? STARC: So ultimately this is going to push CVS even more into being an insurance company rather than a retail pharmacy. It will allow them to have a large, captive audience for that insurance arm, and that might allow them to do a couple of things. They might be able to negotiate lower drug prices from manufacturers by virtue of their sheer size. They might also be able to better align your pharmacy benefits and your health care benefits, right? So we might want to provide pharmacy benefits to incentivize you to do things like fill your blood pressure pills so that you don't end up in the hospital. An integrated insurer would be able to do that. MCEVERS: So I could, like - if I were going on the market to get health insurance, at some point I could be getting CVS health insurance. Is that what's going on here? STARC: Absolutely. Now, it might be that part of your insurance is already provided through CVS. Large national insurers as well as Blue Cross plans will often contract with CVS to provide the pharmacy benefit. So CVS might be providing part of your health insurance whether you know it or not. MCEVERS: So - and we hear this when companies merge, right? They talk about how they'll be able to, you know, use their status to bring prices down, right? But do you really think this would happen? Would drug prices drop for consumers if this merger went through? STARC: So they might be able to negotiate lower prices for manufacturers. The question is whether they'll pass that savings on to consumers. Now, they'll be a large insurer, and they'll have a lot of market power. And so I, for one, am a little skeptical that that will translate into lower prices for consumers. MCEVERS: Right, and instead will transfer into profits for the company. STARC: Exactly. MCEVERS: Is this the future of the health care and pharmacy industry - that they merge like this is? Is that - or have we seen examples in the past of attempts like this that haven't worked? STARC: So we've seen lots of attempts at this type of integration in the past, some more successful than others. I think the fact that CVS has already integrated their retail pharmacy arm with this payer arm means that they're more likely to be successful than some of the other examples we've seen in the past. Whether or not this becomes the broad wave of the future I think remains to be seen. MCEVERS: That's Amanda Starc, associate professor of strategy at the Kellogg School of Management. Thanks again.

npr,"October 27, 2017",An Ethical Dilemma In A Case Of Conjoined Twins From East Africa," In the East African country where they were born, the conjoined twin girls would likely both have died. But even in the wealthiest of nations, it's not easy to make decisions about how to treat conjoined twins. If surgery is warranted, it is a long and difficult procedure. And there are ethical considerations that transcend culture. Dr. Allan Goldstein, who eventually led a team to separate the girls as chief surgeon at MassGeneral Hospital for Children, sums it up: ""So we could say, if we do nothing both will die. If we do something Twin B will survive. That might sound like a simple decision. You have the opportunity to save one instead of losing both. But the truth is that they were two children. It wasn't one child. How do you look at Twin A and say we're going to save your sister?"" The case study of the East African twins was published in this week's issue of The New England Journal of Medicine. For the parents of the twins, it was difficult to seek medical treatment and even to go outside with the children because of the stigma surrounding conjoined twins in their home country. A nonprofit organization connected the family with the hospital. To preserve the family's anonymity, the names of the nonprofit and the country where the family lives are not being released. In mid-2016, the 22-month-old twin girls, who were conjoined at the abdomen and pelvis, came to the U.S. for medical care. Doctors determined that Twin A, as the paper calls her, suffered from congenital heart disease. Doctors believed she would die with or without the separation surgery. And they further believed that if the twins were not separated and Twin A were to die, Twin B would die soon after because of shared blood circulation. Surgery to separate conjoined twins is not often done. Conjoined twins are rare, 1 in every 200,000 births. When a fertilized egg separates, the result is identical twins. But if the fertilized egg fails to fully separate, then it develops into a conjoined fetus. Sometimes without separation, conjoined twins can live long lives, like the famous American pair of Thai heritage, Chang and Eng Bunker, who both lived to be 63 years old. But an outcome like that seemed highly unlikely in this case. Ultimately the choice between letting both children die or operating for the chance of the survival of one ""is heavily influenced by culture and values,"" the paper says. Goldstein recounts the family's thought process: ""They said it was a difficult decision. That no parent would want to lose either child or certainly not both children but that they thought it was the right thing to do for their girls."" In the end, Twin A died and Twin B survived. The outcome of the case is a reminder of the limits of modern medicine in even the wealthiest of countries. Goldstein says that Twin B, now 3 years old, needs surgery for a deformed leg as well as physical therapy but overall is doing well, ""She looks great,"" he says. ""She's always happy, smiling."" And the family is happy with the care it has received. ""Our situation in Africa was very unpleasant,"" the family said in a question-and-answer session after the surgery. ""Here, we've been treated very well, and we've had a very good experience overall. The most difficult part was the uncertainty about the outcome of surgical separation. ... Everyone here was united for our family's cause. We couldn't be prouder or happier of how we all came together for the well-being of our child."" We're all neighbors on our tiny globe.

npr,"October 27, 2017",State Health Officials Met With Trump Before Opioid Crisis Announcement," Yesterday, after meeting with state and federal officials, President Donald Trump declared a public health emergency. The move directs all federal agencies to use their authority to cut the numbers of opioid deaths. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We can be the generation that ends the opioid epidemic. We can do it. (APPLAUSE) MARTIN: Dr. Rebekah Gee was at that meeting with the president. She is the secretary of health for the state of Louisiana. And she joins us now on the line. Doctor Gee, thanks so much for being with us. REBEKAH GEE: Thanks so much. Good morning. MARTIN: Good morning. Did you hear what you wanted to hear from the president yesterday? GEE: Well, what we did here, which is great, is that there is a focus on it. In Louisiana, over the past four years, our deaths have doubled. We lose over a thousand people. That's more than motor vehicle accidents, homicide and suicide combined. So what we heard was a focus. We need more. But I'm very happy that we're embarking on this journey. MARTIN: So there's an important distinction to make here because the president declared a national public health emergency. That is different than declaring a national state of emergency because if he had done the latter, that would have freed up more money - more federal funds to combat the opioid crisis. Do you wish he had done that? GEE: Well, I - we do need more money. And the governor and I - I went with Governor John Bel Edwards. And he and I both spoke with Chris Christie who headed up the opioid commission. We stressed three things - one, how important the Medicaid expansion is for the opioid crisis. In our state, when we started in 2016 in January, 1 in 4 people had no insurance. Now fewer than 1 in 10 lack insurance. Thousands have gotten addiction treatment through the expansion. To end it during an opioid crisis is a huge mistake and would be a big step back. Second, we need relief on naloxone. It's very expensive. It ranges from a hundred dollars to over $4,000 a dose. MARTIN: We should just say, naloxone is this drug that can be used when someone is having an overdose in the moment. GEE: That's right. Narcan, it's also called. It can be injected. And it saves lives. And it needs to be affordable to states. And then, third, we need more resources. Louisiana, it would cost us over $600 million to treat the over 100,000 people who are addicted to opioids. We cannot afford it. We need relief. And so we expect more and hope more from the federal government in terms of additional resources. MARTIN: So how are you going to get that because the 2018 budget plan submitted to Congress - the Trump administration in that plan cut nearly $400 million from substance abuse and mental health services. It's this agency within the Health and Human Services that oversees addiction treatment programs. So where - you say you need more money, but the administration seems to be cutting money for opioid addiction. GEE: Well, after our meeting at the White House in the beautiful East Room, we met with Richard Baum, who's head of - he's the acting drug czar. And he and his staff are still trying to figure out how to implement what Trump said during that meeting as well as to make sense of the specifics in his speech. So, you know, partly, it's that the opioid commission recommendations have not come out yet. So once those come out - and those will be released soon - I expect there to be more action because we - you know, more money is needed for an epidemic of this proportion. You can do things that are no cost. I was excited about the Medicaid policy change where we can do more inpatient treatment. Requiring federal docs to be able to give opioid treatment is very important. MARTIN: Although that only applies to states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. It doesn't help states that didn't do that. GEE: Well, it's hard to say. The - even the drug czar wasn't quite sure what that meant. But it could mean federally qualified health centers and VA docs. And if that's the case, that would be very helpful. Of course, it was announced that CVS had a seven-day limit. That's something we've put in Louisiana. And with those limits, we've seen a 25 percent decrease in less than a year in the number of prescriptions and as well as the overall dosing of opioids. So there are no cost interventions, particularly that can help stop the curb of addiction and those need to happen. But there needs to be money for treatment, and that's just the end of the story. We have to have better prices on Narcan. And we have to have more money for treatment. MARTIN: Let me ask you, just in conclusion, I mean, what can you do at the state level? Six states have already unilaterally declared states of emergency over opioids. Is Louisiana considering doing that? And what would that - what difference would that make? GEE: Well, we have not declared a state of emergency. We've been in a severe budget crisis. So we focused on limiting the number of people who get addicted by making sure that we don't hand out too many pills. Louisiana's the top six in the nation number of pills per people. We have more pills than people every year in our state by far that are given out. So prescription drug monitoring, mandatory physician education - but we just simply do not have the money and need more federal relief. MARTIN: We'll see if that happens. Dr. Rebekah Gee, she is the secretary of health for the state of Louisiana. She was in this meeting with the president yesterday over the opioid epidemic. Thanks so much for your time this morning Dr. Gee. GEE: Thanks very much for having me. Copyright © 2017 NPR.  All rights reserved.

npr,"October 27, 2017",Doctors React To Trump's Opioid Emergency Declaration," We're hearing reaction this morning to President Trump's announcement yesterday that the opioid epidemic is a public health emergency. Yesterday Trump directed federal agencies to use all their authority to fight the drug crisis. He also promised what he said would be a massive ad campaign to convince young people not to start using. NPR's Greg Allen has been asking people on the front lines of this epidemic what all this means for them. GREG ALLEN, BYLINE: Joseph Scott is an emergency room doctor at Baptist Hospital in West Kendall, a Miami suburb. JOSEPH SCOTT: I will reserve judgment, but I'm going to wait and see. I don't see how it's going to really help. ALLEN: Like emergency room doctors around the country, Scott is seeing more and more people arriving with drug overdoses. Typically, doctors revive them, stabilize them and release them. It's not unusual to see them again in the E.R. a day or two later. Scott says the problem he and other doctors face is they don't have places to send patients for detox and recovery. SCOTT: The greatest need is for treatment programs that are available to everyone, available to everyone despite what your insurance status is, whether you have limited insurance, it's a great insurance plan or no insurance. ALLEN: In announcing the public health emergency for opioids, President Trump was following through on an interim recommendation by a commission chaired by New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. Trump also said his administration would begin issuing waivers to states, allowing them to use federal Medicaid funds for in-patient addiction treatment, another of the commission's recommendations. That waiver will be of limited use though in states like Florida that didn't expand Medicaid coverage under the Affordable Care Act. In Palm Beach County, Alton Taylor of the Drug Abuse Foundation says detox and recovery slots for people without health insurance are hard to come by. ALTON TAYLOR: Between detox and residential treatment beds - ten years ago, we had 574 beds. Today we have less than 200. ALLEN: Like many providers, Taylor says he's waiting to see if the emergency declaration brings increased funding. The White House says it will work with Congress in the budgeting process to include more money for opioid prevention, detection and treatment. But in the 2018 budget submitted to Congress, the Trump administration cut nearly $400 billion from Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services, the agency within HHS that oversees addiction treatment programs. MAUREEN KIELIAN: I'm tired of talk. How many more times is he going to say he's going to do something and he's not? ALLEN: Maureen Kielian is with Southeast Florida recovery advocates, a group she helped found after her son became addicted to opioids more than a decade ago. Like others, she's in a wait-and-see mode but glad the president followed through on a pledge he made more than two months ago to declare opioids a national emergency. KIELIAN: Absolutely, we need it because we've lost 10,000 people since he started talking about it. But if it's unfunded - if this is an unfunded mandate, it will not help. And it's nothing but politics. ALLEN: President Trump yesterday promised more action is coming on opioids. He said he'll work to implement the recommendations from the final report of the White House commission after they're delivered next week - Greg Allen, NPR News, Miami.

npr,"October 26, 2017",Pharmaceutical Founder Arrested In Alleged Nationwide Opioid Scheme," On the same day President Trump declared the opioid epidemic a public health emergency, the co-founder of a prominent opioid medication manufacturer has been arrested on fraud and racketeering charges. John Kapoor, former CEO of Insys Therapeutics, has been charged with conspiring to push the company's signature drug for unacceptable uses through a series of bribes and kickbacks. Subsys, as the drug is known, transmits the extremely powerful narcotic fentanyl in spray form, allowing it to be placed beneath the tongue for fast, potent pain relief. It is meant only for treating cancer patients suffering from severe pain. But according to prosecutors, Kapoor and several other former high-ranking executives at the company conspired to bribe doctors to write ""large numbers of prescriptions for the patients, most of whom were not diagnosed with cancer."" They also allegedly ""conspired to mislead and defraud health insurance providers who were reluctant to approve payment for the drug when it was prescribed for non-cancer patients."" Forbes reported last year on some of the legal questions around the company and the pharmaceutical entrepreneur: ""In 2015 a nurse practitioner in Connecticut pleaded guilty to violating a federal antikickback statute by taking money from Insys to prescribe the drug to Medicare patients who did not have cancer. A former Insys sales representative in Alabama also pleaded guilty to a conspiracy to violate the antikickback statute by paying two doctors to prescribe the drug. Illinois has filed claims against Insys related to pushing Subsys for unapproved uses. U.S. attorneys in two jurisdictions — the Central District of California and the District of Massachusetts — are investigating the company. Doctors who have worked with the company are being investigated by Michigan, Florida, Kansas, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and New York."" As Reuters reports, Kapoor stepped down as chief executive in January. ""In the midst of a nationwide opioid epidemic that has reached crisis proportions,"" acting U.S. Attorney William D. Weinreb said in a statement, ""Mr. Kapoor and his company stand accused of bribing doctors to overprescribe a potent opioid and committing fraud on insurance companies solely for profit. ""Today's arrest and charges reflect our ongoing efforts to attack the opioid crisis from all angles,"" Weinreb added. Kapoor was arrested in Arizona, where Insys is based, and his indictment was filed in federal court in Boston. Prosecutors say the charges of conspiracy to commit racketeering and conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud each carry a maximum sentence of up to 20 years in prison. Conspiracy to violate the anti-kickback law carries a possible penalty of up to five years in prison.

npr,"October 26, 2017",Trump Declares Opioid Crisis A Public Health Emergency," In a ceremony at the White House today, President Trump declared the opioid crisis a nationwide public health emergency. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I am directing all executive agencies to use every appropriate emergency authority to fight the opioid crisis. MCEVERS: The question now is what the next steps will be for the administration and for Congress. NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith reports. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: President Trump's announcement was more than two months in the making. He first promised to declare an emergency back in early August. Now with families affected by the opioid crisis standing behind him and members of Congress from both parties in the audience, President Trump made it official. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: Our current addiction crisis and especially the epidemic of opioid deaths will get worse before it gets better. But get better it will. It will take many years and even decades to address this scourge in our society, but we must start in earnest now to combat national health emergency. KEITH: Precisely how it will work, how agencies will use the emergency powers isn't yet clear. Advocates say there are a number of actions that could be taken to make more treatment beds available and to get lifesaving rescue drugs into more people's hands. In his remarks, President Trump put a lot of emphasis on prevention. He talked about his brother Fred whose life was destroyed by alcoholism. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: He would constantly tell me, don't drink. He'd also add, don't smoke. But he would say it over and over and over again. KEITH: Trump said it worked for him. He hasn't had a drink in his life. And he suggested a national advertising campaign to tell kids not to start using drugs. Trump also talked about research into non-addictive pain medication and about the need to provide effective treatment for those who need it. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: We understand the need to confront reality right smack in the face that millions of our fellow citizens are already addicted. That's the reality. We want them to get help they need. We have no choice but to help these people that are hooked and are suffering. KEITH: But on its own, the public health emergency declaration doesn't free up any additional funding to meet these goals. Members of Congress from both sides of the aisle said what they're looking to the White House for now is action and a push for funding. Congresswoman Annie Kuster is a Democrat from New Hampshire who is leading a bipartisan task force on the heroin epidemic. ANNIE KUSTER: He has gotten the headline in terms of making the emergency declaration. But the real test will be what comes next. We need extensive funding. KEITH: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie chairs a commission the president created to study the opioid crisis and spoke outside of the White House following the event. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CHRIS CHRISTIE, BYLINE: It's now going to be incumbent upon Congress to work with the administration to put money in the public health emergency fund to help the states deal with this problem. For members of Congress who say, where's the money, I read the Constitution. The money starts with them. KEITH: An administration official refused to say how much funding the White House plans to ask for, but some in Congress are talking about not just hundreds of millions of dollars but billions. There's already a fight over government funding set to happen in December. Most expect funding the opioid response will be part of those negotiations. Tamara Keith, NPR News, the White House.

npr,"October 26, 2017",Addiction Prevention Advocate On Trump's Public Health Emergency Declaration," Gary Mendell told me he takes heart in the emphasis the president placed on curbing opioid prescriptions on the front lines in doctors' offices. And now that he knows the will is there, I asked him what concrete steps he'd like to see the administration take from here. GARY MENDELL: Well, ideally I would like for every prescriber in the country not only to have to be educated in proper prescribing but also to sign a document that they adopt the CDC guideline as a standard of care. And if every doctor in the country were to do that, it would be totally a sea change in prescribing practices. SIEGEL: The CDC of course the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. MENDELL: Correct. SIEGEL: What do you say to the observation that even if we got things right at the point of prescribing opioids, we would still have the situation on the streets with fentanyl and with heroin and that indeed a lot of the people in need of treatment are not taking prescription drugs; they're taking street drugs? MENDELL: Sure. I would give two responses to that. Number one, let's have less people become addicted. That's the best treatment - is prevention. And the best way to do that is prescribing practices. And reducing the number of pills being prescribed is going to reduce the number of people who use heroin or ultimately fentanyl because 80 percent of those who use heroin today started with prescription painkillers. And then related to treatment, addiction is the only major disease in this country without a national standard of care for the treatment of addiction. You can go to 10 doctors for heart disease. Each of the doctors will treat you the same way. But for addiction, everyone is treated with all different methods. So what this country needs to have is a national standard of care for the treatment of addiction. SIEGEL: Just one other question, if I might. And I ask this because I know that you've - because of the terrible situation with your own son losing his life to addiction. You've no doubt thought a lot about addiction and what it's all about. Some years ago, I went to Kansas where there was an epidemic of methamphetamine abuse, a terrible drug that was really ruining lives. People were cooking it in garages. They were blowing up their homes by mistake in trying to cook this drug. And they were using it without doctors to prescribe, without foreign drug suppliers sending drugs yet into the country. When do we get to whatever the hunger is, whatever the need is for drugs? MENDELL: Well, there's no one simple answer. For opioids, it's very simple in overprescribing. We are prescribing today three times the amount of pills that we prescribed 15 years ago, and we still prescribe four times the amount that they do in the United Kingdom - four times per person. So if we bring that down into balance, everything will improve. Fewer people will become addicted. Less treatment will be needed. Less people will move to heroin because they haven't started with prescription painkillers. It's really one simple fix related to the opiate situation. Related to all drugs, as a society, we're too much about pills for solutions and less about resistance as a society to what we may feel emotionally or pain we may have externally. SIEGEL: Mr. Mendell, thank you very much for talking with us about it today. MENDELL: It's my pleasure. And I really appreciate you bringing awareness to everything we've talked about. So thank you. SIEGEL: That's Gary Mendell of the advocacy group Shatterproof. Copyright © 2017 NPR.  All rights reserved.

npr,"October 26, 2017",'They Need Help': Trump Faces Backlash For Slow Response To Opioid Crisis," President Trump declared the opioid crisis a public health emergency on Thursday, freeing up resources to deal with the epidemic. Last year, more than 64,000 people died from drug overdoses, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Center for Health Statistics. Many of those overdoses were from heroin, prescription painkillers, fentanyl and other opioids. James Dlutowski, a paramedic for the Pittsburgh Bureau of Emergency Services, has viewed this crisis from the front lines. He says he responds to overdose calls ""probably at least daily,"" and the number has significantly increased over the past few years. ""We see a lot more today than we ever have,"" he tells Here &amp; Now's Meghna Chakrabarti. ""In October of '14 we had seen like 70 overdoses total. [In 2015] it was up into the 90s, and then [in 2016] it was over 200."" In Pennsylvania, drug overdose deaths increased by almost 40 percent from March 2016 to March 2017, according to CDC data. The most significant increases occurred in Delaware and the District of Columbia, where overdoses rose by 65 percent and 114 percent, respectively. The president's announcement gives states more leeway to spend federal money in response to the rise in drug overdose deaths. It also broadens the reach of medical services in rural areas. ""I think declaring an emergency is important, but it is not going to make much difference if we don't actually put resources towards this public health crisis,"" says Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo. She tells Here &amp; Now's Jeremy Hobson she hopes ""the administration realizes there is not an easy fix to this. It is complex, and there's many different parts to it."" Dlutowski agrees that solving the issue is complicated. He says his team often sees people overdose more than once in the same day. ""There's like this vicious loop where there's not a lot of vectors to deliver patients to treatment centers directly from the field,"" he says. People often refuse transport to the hospital because they are ""so focused on getting high again,"" Dlutowski explains. If they do go to the hospital, people often leave before receiving treatment. ""They get frustrated because of the time it takes to try to get them treatment options,"" he says. ""They'll leave the emergency room against medical advice, and then just be back with the same people, in the same environment, within just a couple of hours and then re-overdose."" The CDC reports that drug overdoses are the leading cause of death for people under 50. The young age of those affected is one of the most disheartening aspects of this crisis, Dlutowski says. ""Coming in contact with a 20-year-old who had their whole life ahead of them and now they're dead, and there's nothing you can do, like that is a significant increase than we had seen prior to the epidemic,"" he says. Despite increased access to opioid antidotes, such as naloxone or Narcan, Dlutowski says first responders don't administer the drugs for every overdose — most people just need oxygen. He says the government should focus on funding for addiction treatment. ""Spending more money on Narcan and less money on resources for treatment for their actual addiction might be taking us the wrong way,"" he says. ""And I think it's really important to focus on prevention, and then for the people who are already addicted, focus on treatment options to help reverse the addiction."" McCaskill says the opioid crisis reflects how the U.S. health care system treats mental health and addiction as compared to other health crises. ""I think that we have always given mental health issues a short shrift,"" she says. ""We have a Zika virus, and everyone is on full-blown panic attack. But people start dying all over the country from heroin overdose, and we were way too slow to recognize the epic proportions that this had reached because the genesis of this problem, so much of it, is rooted in our medical system, our health care system."" Dlutowski agrees the efforts to mitigate the crisis must focus on getting people the help they need. ""The most important thing is that we can't forget the humanity of it,"" he says. ""The overdoses affect every single person. And even though that person makes really bad choices, they are still people, and it's a medical condition, and they need help.""

npr,"October 26, 2017",What Opioid Decision Means To Hard-Hit States Like West Virginia," The administration says that going that route will better allow them to address the crisis on a nationwide basis. What it does not do is direct any new funding to tackling the crisis. Let's talk about what this means for a hard-hit state - the state of West Virginia where Dr. Rahul Gupta is the state's health officer. He joins us via Skype. Good morning, sir. RAHUL GUPTA: Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: Is the president's action going far enough for you? GUPTA: Well, we believe it's a good first step in ensuring that this crisis has provided enough of an opportunity to make sure that people understand what this is and how much devastation has been caused by it. I often equivalate (ph) it to the equivalence of a Boeing 737 crashing every single day in terms of we're losing about 150 Americans every single day. It is important to provide that light to this problem. INSKEEP: And what makes the problem especially severe in West Virginia? GUPTA: What has been critical is the declining economy as, obviously, the job losses that have caused - in addition to the shipment of hundreds of millions of pills into the state in terms of opioids that has actually worsened. And so we've reached a perfect storm type of situation a few years ago that caused people, on one hand, to lose hope but, on the other hand, to have these highly addictive substances with a very rugged population in terms of having a lot of the coal mining and laborious jobs, which caused really the epicenter of the epidemic. INSKEEP: Can people get treatment if they need it - most people in West Virginia? GUPTA: Treatment infrastructure is a challenge that states like West Virginia face. We have made a significant amount of progress but not sufficient as of today. And we certainly need to have more resources in order to have more of a 21st century treatment system available. We're working on them. But we certainly have a long way to go to ensure that everyone who needs treatment is able to get the treatment. INSKEEP: So if the president called you up and said, what do you need, what would you tell him? GUPTA: I would say that we need to prioritize, first of all, the overdosing and both the fatalities as well as non-fatal overdoses to ensure that every one of these people is looked upon as a cry for help and enters into treatment. And we must ensure to have the infrastructure in order to get these people into treatment, rehabilitation, recovery and then back into the workforce. The second thing I would say in terms of that we also need to focus on providing resources to drugs like naloxone and others for opioid treatment programs as well as.... INSKEEP: Oh, that's an antidote drug. OK, sure. GUPTA: Yeah. Antidotes as well as the treatment program in terms of MAT. We also have to focus on the drug-dependent babies that are being born today and working upstream to help prevent these from happening in the first place, whether it's the long-acting reversible contraceptives or treatment and recovery of women while they're pregnant. So we are not dealing with downstream impact of a lost generation of babies 15 to 20 years from today as a consequence of one generation's impact on the other. INSKEEP: So I heard you use the word infrastructure. I heard you use the word resources. Both of those translate into money. What do you think about the fact that so far as we know the president's announcement is not going to bring with it extra federal money? GUPTA: Yeah. I think the - this declaration typically would do two things. One is to remove a stigma and shed light. And the second would be - typically, would be to bring resources in terms of - perhaps, there's an opportunity now for Congress to act to fund the public health emergency fund and to direct those resources specifically for this crisis is critical. We say that because there is - addressing this crisis today is critical to preventing further death, disease and destruction in the lives of Americans in the years to come. So if we are going to prevent disease outbreaks - address this problem today - we need to make sure that it is sufficiently funded from a resource standpoint. INSKEEP: Dr. Rahul Gupta, the state health officer of West Virginia, thank you very much. GUPTA: Thank you, Steve. Copyright © 2017 NPR.  All rights reserved.

npr,"October 26, 2017","In Opioid Crisis, Public Health Emergency Vs. National Emergency"," Later today, President Trump is expected to address the nation about this country's opioid epidemic. On average, nearly 150 Americans a week are dying from overdoses, many of them from heroin, fentanyl and other opioids - so safe to say this is a dire situation. Administration officials say the president will direct the Health and Human Services secretary to declare a public health emergency. And to help us sort through exactly what that means, we're joined by NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith, who has been covering this issue. Good morning, Tam. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Good morning. GREENE: So long-awaited decision from the president - sounds like not exactly what some people were expecting. Tell us how the White House reached where they are today. KEITH: So this began back at the end of July when a commission that the president appointed to study the opioid crisis came back with what it described as urgent recommendations, including the recommendation that the president declare an emergency. They suggested a couple of different kinds of emergency, either the kind that you do under FEMA or a public health emergency. The White House - the president, about two weeks after that recommendation came out, was asked about it by reporters. He said, it's an emergency; it's an emergency; I'm declaring it emergency; we're drawing up the paperwork now. It's been more than two months since then, and the administration has really struggled to figure out what exactly to do. And now they have settled on this public health emergency. GREENE: OK, public health emergency - you mentioned FEMA. One option would've been some sort of national emergency, the kind that we would see because of a disaster. Is that - that would've been one option. KEITH: Yeah. So I was talking to Dr. Bertha Madras. She is a professor of psychobiology at the Harvard Medical School. She's also a member of the president's opioid commission. And she said that they felt that - in their hearts that this was something to do, though they hadn't really thought through all the logistics. Here's a little bit from the interview I did with her. BERTHA MADRAS: FEMA can declare a natural disaster - hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, what have you. The secretary of Health and Human Services can declare an emergency if you have an infectious disease or poisonings. But this is different. There's no precedent for this. KEITH: Right. And the administration officials are defending the choice to go with a public health emergency, saying that that will allow them to do this on more of a nationwide basis, that the FEMA-type disasters are more specific to a point in time and a specific location but that this will be nationwide. GREENE: OK, so let's talk about what this public health emergency will actually mean, what this declaration will do in terms of dealing with this crisis. KEITH: Yeah, so administration officials say that it will allow - I think the most substantial part of this is that it will allow for standard access to telemedicine services. This opioid crisis has been particularly challenging in more rural areas of Appalachia and the Rust Belt, where there is a shortage of doctors and where - really, the public health community has come around to the view that the best way to help most people is through medication-assisted treatment. But there aren't doctors to prescribe those medicines and oversee that treatment, and so this would allow telemedicine - people to see doctors virtually to get the help that they need. It also includes some smaller things that the Department of Labor could do - something to do with hiring personnel, reducing some of the bureaucracy, but it - and shifting around existing funding. Also, the administration says an important part of this is just sort of making it a bigger issue, trying to reduce the stigma and bring this issue out of the shadows. GREENE: Because there are many people who don't come out of the shadows to get treatment because they might not want people in their community, their family, to even know that they're suffering from this. KEITH: That's right, though there's also serious issues with whether some of these treatments are covered by insurance, whether people have insurance. GREENE: Tam, you said something that really caught my ear, which was shifting existing funding around. As we were reporting on this leading up in the last days and weeks, many people said, if this is declared a national emergency, it might free up a lot of federal funding to help states. So with this public health emergency, is there new money associated with it? KEITH: There is a fund associated with public health emergencies. That fund is empty, so Congress hasn't filled it, and Congress will need to fill it if there's going to be an infusion of any new cash into this problem. The White House says they're working with Congress to make that part of any sort of end-of-year budget negotiations or budget deal. GREENE: Oh, that's interesting. So this might be one of those - another problem that the president has come out and said he wants to address, but it's going to involve a lot of working with Congress to make it actually happen. KEITH: Yes, absolutely. But Congress is willing, and I know of senators from both parties who will be at the White House today for this announcement. They've been begging the White House, really, to get involved, to help, to do more. They are - they tell me they are ready to be partners on this. GREENE: All right, Tam, thanks a lot. KEITH: You're welcome. GREENE: That is NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith talking to us about this announcement expected from President Trump addressing the nation's opioid epidemic.

npr,"October 26, 2017",Reductions In Federal Funding For Health Law Navigators Cut Unevenly," Nearly half of the federal funding has been cut for the navigator program that Shelli Quenga leads for South Carolina's Palmetto Project. Despite all of the efforts in Congress to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act this year, it remains the law of the land. People can start signing up for health insurance for 2018 starting Nov. 1. But the landscape for the law has changed a lot. Take navigators, for instance. Those are specially trained people who help consumers sign up for coverage. In August, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services cut funding for navigators by 41 percent. But the effects vary. For some groups and some states, the cuts go deeper while others will have almost as much money as they did before. South Carolina and North Carolina are cases in point. South Carolina's navigator funding is about two-thirds less than the state received in fiscal 2017, while most of North Carolina's funding is intact. The Trump administration has said that it is rewarding groups that did a good job and cutting off those that didn't. But the strategy may have the effect of hobbling navigators who have the most daunting job enrolling people. ""We are between the rock and the hard place,"" says Shelli Quenga, who runs programs at the nonprofit Palmetto Project, South Carolina's largest navigator group. ""We know that people in rural areas don't have as much Internet access. The people who need help are probably in the rural areas, but we can't afford [to send navigators there].""

 Ilia Henderson (left) is planning to sign up for a health insurance plan on the federal marketplace with help from Charlotte, N.C.-based navigator Julieanne Taylor (right) again this year. Instead, Quenga says, she will have to be strategic about where she plans to place navigators. ""It is based on those areas that are (a) more densely populated and (b) had a higher level of ACA enrollment for 2017,"" she explains. That means about two-thirds of the state's counties will not have a navigator. Quenga is still planning to help people in those areas by using screen-sharing technology to walk people through sign-ups. She adds that people can always call the federal call center for help. But that's not ideal, she says. Quenga says her employees really take the time to work through complicated cases. For example, she says, ""Lots of people have family members sleeping on their couch. Do you count that person as a tax dependent or not?"" The answer is complicated. How much financial aid someone gets is based on his or her taxable income, which changes with the number of dependents, she says. ""Choosing whether to include that person as a dependent can have big consequences in terms of your financial assistance,"" she says. ""The call center is not set up to run those scenarios for you."" And with less help from the federal government, Quenga feels the pressure mounting to get more people signed up for coverage during this year's shorter enrollment period. If she does, there's a chance her navigator group will be better funded next year. The picture is very different in North Carolina. There, navigator groups had only about 10 percent of their federal funding cut. Jennifer Simmons, who coordinates North Carolina's largest navigator program, the NC Navigator Consortium, says she is happy to report there will be someone available in each of the state's 100 counties during the six weeks of open enrollment this year. They will help people like Ilia Henderson, who is 26 and lives in Huntersville, just outside Charlotte. She is one of those young healthy people insurance companies want and she is getting ready to sign up for coverage with navigator Julieanne Taylor. Last year, Taylor helped Henderson, a massage therapist and student, sign up for a medical and dental plan within half an hour for just over $100 a month. She looks forward to working with Taylor to find a similarly good deal for 2018. Simmons says her navigators will be in libraries, public health departments and even churches around the state. ""We are remaining really laser-focused on making sure that consumers across North Carolina are able to get info they need. There are a lot of people that need renewal services and help in making sure that the marketplace has their updated information and that the plan that they are in is still the right plan for their family,"" Simmons says. ""But we are also trying to reach new people."" Last year, North Carolina had one of the highest marketplace enrollments, with more than half a million people signing up. South Carolina, with about half of North Carolina's population, has about 183,000 people enrolled. Sabrina Corlette, with Georgetown University's Center on Health Insurance Reform, says sign-ups are likely to drop during this open enrollment period. ""It's just been decision after decision,"" she says. ""Including this navigator funding cut that will ultimately lead not to just lower enrollment in the marketplaces but sicker enrollment in the marketplaces."" If that happens, Corlette says, count on higher premiums in 2019 with fewer people in the insurance pool. This story is part of a reporting partnership with NPR, WFAE and Kaiser Health News.

npr,"October 26, 2017",Narcan Opioid Overdose Spray Is Now Stocked By All Walgreens Pharmacies," It has the power to save lives by targeting opioid overdoses — something that kills more than 140 Americans every day. And now Narcan, the nasal spray that can pull a drug user back from an overdose, is being carried by all of Walgreens' more than 8,000 pharmacies. ""By stocking Narcan in all our pharmacies, we are making it easier for families and caregivers to help their loved ones by having it on hand in case it is needed,"" said Walgreens vice president Rick Gates. The pharmacy chain is making the move as America struggles to respond to an opioid epidemic that President Trump is declaring a national emergency on Thursday, hoping to fight the opioid crisis that has struck families and communities from rural areas to cities. Calling the Walgreens move ""an important milestone,"" Seamus Mulligan, CEO of Narcan maker Adapt Pharma, said that letting people get the medicine ""without an individual prescription in 45 states is critical in combating this crisis."" In recent years, both Walgreens, the nation's No. 2 pharmacy chain, and CVS, the No. 1 chain, have moved to widen access to Narcan and other products that contain naloxone, a fast-acting overdose antidote. As of last month, CVS reportedly offered prescription-free naloxone in 43 states. The chain has said that its pharmacies ""in most communities have naloxone on hand and can dispense it the same day or ordered for the next business day."" Previously, Walgreens made the opioid antidote available in 33 states and Washington, D.C.; the new plan calls for stocking it in an additional 2,200 stores nationwide. The company says it will also inform customers about Narcan if they are given drugs with more than 50 morphine milligram equivalents. As both demand and access to overdose antidotes have risen, so have prices: While Narcan has been a steady $125, a naloxone auto-injector called Evzio now costs thousands of dollars, as NPR's Alison Kodjak reported in August. Lower prices are available through insurance programs; many first-responder agencies also get the drug at a lower rate. In 2015, a total of 52,404 people died in the United States from drug overdoses, and 33,091 of them died from overdoses involving opioids, the CDC said. In 2016, overdose deaths soared to more than 64,000 — with fentanyl and its analogs accounting for more than 20,000 fatal overdoses, according to the agency's data. Whether they've overdosed on heroin, synthetic opioids such as fentanyl, or prescription drugs such as oxycodone and hydrocodone, patients have been able to recover after receiving naloxone. The National Institute on Drug Abuse calls naloxone ""an opioid antagonist—meaning that it binds to opioid receptors and can reverse and block the effects of other opioids. It can very quickly restore normal respiration to a person whose breathing has slowed or stopped as a result of overdosing with heroin or prescription opioid pain medications.""

npr,"October 26, 2017",Trump Administration Declares Opioid Crisis A Public Health Emergency," According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 140 Americans die every day from an opioid overdose. Updated at 2:50 p.m. ET President Trump declared a public health emergency to deal with the opioid epidemic Thursday, freeing up some resources for treatment. More than 140 Americans die every day from an opioid overdose, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""We are currently dealing with the worst drug crisis in American history,"" Trump said, adding, ""it's just been so long in the making. Addressing it will require all of our effort.""  ""We can be the generation that ends the opioid epidemic,"" he said. Trump also directed agency and department heads to use all appropriate emergency authorities to reduce the number of deaths caused by the opioid crisis. Trump spoke personally about his brother Fred who struggled with alcoholism and died in his 40s. Because of him, Trump said, he had never tried alcohol or cigarettes. ""He would tell me 'don't drink, don't drink,' "" Trump said. ""He had a very, very, very tough life because of alcohol."" The administration will also launch an ad campaign so that young people can see ""the devastation and ruination [drugs cause] people and people's lives."" The move stops short of declaring the crisis a national emergency, which Trump first said in August that he would declare. He repeated that pledge this week. But the White House said it determined that declaring a public health emergency was more appropriate than a national emergency. Dr. Andrew Kolodny, co-director of the Opioid Policy Research Collaboration at Brandeis University's Heller School, calls the announcement ""very disappointing."" Without funding for new addiction treatment, he says, declaring a public health emergency isn't enough. ""This is not a plan,"" he says. ""The administration still has no plan"" for dealing with opioids, he says. After taking office, Trump created a commission to study the opioid crisis, headed by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. In an interim report, the commission called on the president to declare a national emergency under either the Public Health Service Act or the Stafford Act. Doing so, the commission said, could free up funds for treatment, ensure wider access to the anti-overdose drug naloxone and improve monitoring of opioid prescriptions to prevent abuse. Public health emergencies expire after 90 days, although the administration says they can easily be renewed. The designation gives the administration access to the Public Health Emergency Fund, but that fund is nearly empty.  In outlining its opioid plan, administration officials highlighted four areas. It allows expanded access to telemedicine services, giving doctors the ability to prescribe medications to treat addiction to those in remote locations. It speeds the hiring process for medical professionals working on opioids. And it allows funds in programs for dislocated workers and people with HIV/AIDS to be used to treat their addictions. Dr. Keith Humphreys, a professor of psychiatry at Stanford University and a former adviser in the Obama administration, calls the Trump administration's response ""pathetic,"" saying it mostly repurposes long-existing public health programs. Humphreys notes that aside from the emergency declaration, there is little that was recommended by the White House commission in the president's plan. The commission had also recommended rapidly increasing treatment capacity for recovering addicts by granting Medicaid waivers, mandating educational initiatives at medical and dental schools to tighten opioid prescribing, and funding a program to expand access to medications used to treat addictions. In a briefing Thursday, the administration said some of these initiatives are underway. The Food and Drug Administration has already expanded education requirements around prescribing opioids, officials said. Just this week, the FDA director told a congressional committee that the agency will begin working to promote medication-assisted treatment — using methadone, buprenorphine or naltrexone to help addicts in recovery — although that initiative doesn't carry any additional funding. The final report of the White House's commission on opioids is due next week.  On Thursday, Christie praised the president for what he called ""bold action."" Christie said, ""The President is showing an unprecedented commitment to fighting this epidemic and placing the weight of the Presidency behind saving lives across the country."" The biggest question mark surrounding the president's plan for addressing opioids involves money. Congress is currently spending $500 million a year on addiction treatment programs, but that money runs out next year. The administration says it will work with Congress in the budgeting process to find new money to fund addiction treatment programs. This week, a group of Democratic senators introduced a bill that would provide more than $45 billion for opioid abuse prevention, surveillance and treatment. Not coincidentally, that is the same amount of money Republican sponsors included for preventing opioid abuse in bills that would have repealed the Affordable Care Act. Humphreys, a former official in the Office of National Drug Control Policy, says that if the president is serious about opioids, he should endorse that bill. Another option would be to restore a funding cut proposed for Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the agency within the Department of Health and Human Services that oversees addiction treatment programs. In its 2018 budget, the Trump administration is proposing cutting the agency's budget by nearly $400 million. NPR thanks our sponsors Become an NPR sponsor ",http://www.npr.org/560083795
npr,"October 26, 2017",Court To Rule On Whether Relapse By An Addicted Opioid User Should Be A Crime," Julie Eldred is back at home in Massachusetts now. But she was sentenced to a treatment program for opioid addiction as part of a probation agreement, then sent to jail when she relapsed. Some addiction specialists say that's unjust. Julie Eldred has been struggling with addiction to opioids for more than a decade and she says the criminal justice system punishes her for it. Eldred, a part-time pet caretaker in Acton, Mass., was put on probation last year for theft. She knew staying drug-free would be tough — especially at first, when she was going through opioid withdrawal. But, she says, she didn't have much of a choice. ""I was in the midst of active addiction, so I was actively using. But you're forced to go into this saying I'll be drug-free or you go to jail,"" Eldred says. She complied with her probation conditions, she says — she found outpatient treatment, addiction medication and a therapist — but she failed a drug test. Eldred told her probation officer that she had just started treatment and had relapsed, but was now back on track. Eldred says her probation officer didn't care. ""She didn't look at that picture,"" Eldred says. ""She didn't look [to see] that I had just gotten started getting everything in order. She just saw that I had a 'dirty urine,' and she just sent me in front of the judge to go to jail."" The judge sentenced Eldred to jail for the probation violation; Eldred says she received no treatment. ""I had a cellmate in there for murder, but she wasn't sentenced yet,"" Eldred says. ""You're with people who know they're going to be sentenced and they know they're going to be in there a long time, so they don't care. There is a lot of violence — girls will jump you. It's scary."" Ten days later, Eldred was released from jail when her lawyer found a bed in a residential treatment facility. That lawyer — Lisa Newman-Polk — brought Eldred's case to Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, arguing that the courts should not punish people for having the disease of addiction. ""This idea that a court can order a person to stop using — with the threat of punishment — is not grounded in reality,"" Newman-Polk says. ""If it worked to punish people for addiction and relapse we would have a cured nation."" Newman-Polk argues that courts should take into account scientific research about addiction, and apply it in practice — much as courts have done with the science about brain development and juvenile offenders. She says addiction is a medical condition, so it's unconstitutional to incarcerate someone for relapsing — because that's part of the disease. ""An order to be drug-free is an order that a person with a substance use disorder needs to be in remission or cured of addiction. It's not practical or reasonable, in view of what we know about the brain science and what we know about addiction,"" Newman-Polk says. The science of addiction is mentioned in all the legal briefs filed in this case — many focus on what research says about how much control patients like Eldred have over their drug use, and whether consequences like jail actually motivate patients to stop using. A brief from the Massachusetts Medical Society says relapse is a symptom of addiction that needs to be treated, not punished. ""Even Lindbergh bounced down the runway a couple of times before he became airborne,"" says Massachusetts Medical Society President Dr. Henry Dorkin, ""and we would not want to incarcerate people at the first sign of relapse if we're treating this as a chronic disease."" But the opposing briefs argue that there is not consensus about whether addiction is a brain disease that leaves someone powerless over drug use. The National Association of Drug Court Professionals says supervision and drug testing help keep people in recovery. It says specialty drug courts are effective and already work to get help for addicted defendants, rather than incarcerate them. It warns the Massachusetts court not to allow ""any particular theory of addiction to influence its decision."" 
                Eldred, at home with her dog, Bubbles, says she's committed to her recovery from opioid addiction. ""But,"" she adds, ""I can't say that I won't ever relapse again. Right now I feel strong, but this is a lifelong journey.""

 Eldred, at home with her dog, Bubbles, says she's committed to her recovery from opioid addiction. ""But,"" she adds, ""I can't say that I won't ever relapse again. Right now I feel strong, but this is a lifelong journey."" One of those writing on that side is Gene Heyman, a senior lecturer in psychology at Boston College. He cites studies that say that many people stop using drugs and alcohol on their own — oftentimes because they face negative consequences if they don't. ""The empirical question at stake is, if you ask someone not to use drugs and you provide a reason not to use, can the person respond ?"" Heyman says. ""And the data say yes they can — they can stop using drugs."" The Massachusetts attorney general points out that Eldred was on probation for theft — and that she did eventually go into drug treatment because otherwise she would go to jail. During the state's supreme court hearing on the case this month, the justices asked tough questions of both sides. Justice Barbara Lenk asked Newman-Polk where judges should draw the line if someone can't control their behavior. ""Now, if somebody didn't have the ability to resist the urge to use drugs, how is it that she could resist the urge to commit other petty crimes in order to support her drug habit ? How is it that she could have the self-control to continue in a treatment program that presumably doesn't want her to use drugs?"" Lenk asked. Crimes should be punished, Newman-Polk responded, but committing crimes is not a symptom of addiction. Maria Granik, a Massachusetts assistant attorney general, argued for the state, saying that addiction is not a defense for a probation violation or for criminal responsibility in general. Granik also argued that incarceration is one tool judges can use if necessary. But what if a judge decided to use the probation violation to sentence Eldred for the underlying crime of larceny, Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court Chief Justice Ralph Gantz asked Granik. ""What you need to come to grips with — and I don't hear it frankly,"" Gantz went on, ""is, is it appropriate for a judge under these circumstances, recognizing that relapse routinely occurs in these circumstances, to impose a two-and-a-half-year sentence in the House of Correction for her probation violation?"" ""I don't think we could go that far,"" Granik answered. Gantz says the high court will likely issue guidelines for all courts so judges can determine how to handle what has become a revolving door in the criminal justice system for those addicted. ""This is a really challenging issue, and each side needs to come to grips with it, because judges have to do this each and every day,"" Gantz says. The Massachusetts Bar Association expects the high court's ruling will cause state lawmakers to fund more addiction treatment. Martin Healy, the association's chief legal counsel and chief operating officer, believes the ruling will set a precedent. ""It is probably going to be one of the most important cases that our court will bring down — over the last decade,"" Healy says. ""And I think it will result in some dramatic changes to the way that society treats addiction.""  As for Julie Eldred, she is no longer on probation and says she's committed to working on her recovery. ""Hopefully this is it,"" Elred says. ""But I can't say that I won't ever relapse again. Right now I feel strong, but this is a lifelong journey. Some people think you get clean and that should be it. It's not."" A ruling from Massachusetts highest court is expected by spring.

npr,"October 25, 2017","When A Boy Sticks Magnets Up His Nose, Doctors Have To Get Ingenious"," Kids stick things in their nose, ears, and mouth all the time; it may be another way for them to explore and learn. But getting those objects out be challenging, and can take some creativity. Like when an 11-year-old boy put button magnets up both nostrils, where they locked tightly onto his septum. According to a report published Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine, the boy, unable to get the magnets out and in pain, ended up in the emergency room. The boy, who lives in Cyprus, was taken into the operating room and put under general anesthesia There, doctors ingeniously turned the problem into the solution. They positioned household magnets on the outside of the boy's nose, and used them to gently maneuver the magnets out. Magnets have long posed health problems for kids. A 2013 study in the Annals of Emergency Medicine found that between 2002 and 2011, there were over 22,500 magnet-related injuries in those under 21. Most were from swallowing them, but 21 percent were nose-related. It's no small matter — magnets in the body can cause serious damage and even death. When an 8-year-old girl in Seattle swallowed rare earth magnets, she ended up with an ulcer forcing the removal of 10 centimeters of damaged intestine. Younger children are more likely to swallow the small, powerful magnets, while older children are more likely to stick them up the nose or use them to imitate piercings. The Consumer Product Safety Commission has warned against toys containing the small magnets, but they remain easy to buy. ""We fish things out of children's ears, noses, and throats on almost a daily basis."" says Dr. Craig Derkay, director of pediatric otolaryngology at Children's Hospital of The King's Daughters in Norfolk, Va. He's particularly concerned about button batteries, which are often found in watches and toys. As Shots reported back in 2012, they can cause burns and kill tissue. Fortunately, the boy with the magnets up his nose had a happy outcome. Six months and some nose splints later, the boy and his nose were healthy again.

npr,"October 25, 2017",Troubling History In Medical Research Still Fresh For Black Americans," It's a Sunday morning at the Abyssinian Baptist Church, a famous African-American church in the Harlem area of New York City. The organist plays as hundreds of worshippers stream into the pews. The Rev. Calvin O. Butts III steps to the pulpit. ""Now may we stand for our call to worship,"" says Butts, as he begins a powerful three-hour service filed with music, dancing, prayers and preaching. ""How good and pleasant it is when all of God's children get together."" Then, about an hour into the service, Butts does something he has never done before. ""I would like to introduce the Precision Medicine Initiative,"" he says, referring to a huge new project sponsored by the National Institutes of Health. It's now called All of Us. ""It is a landmark longitudinal research effort that aims to engage 1 million participants of all ethnicities to improve our ability to prevent and treat disease based on individual differences in lifestyle, environment and genetic makeup,"" Butts says. Why is this famous preacher at this famous African-American church talking about a big government medical study in the middle of Sunday service? To understand that, I visit a clinic more than 30 blocks away at Columbia University. That's where I meet Anne and Steve Halliwell of Irvington, N.Y., who just volunteered for the study. 
                Steve Halliwell (left), a volunteer in the study, has his height measured for a second time by Dan Nguyen, a research assistant involved in the All of Us research initiative.

 Steve Halliwell (left), a volunteer in the study, has his height measured for a second time by Dan Nguyen, a research assistant involved in the All of Us research initiative. ""Sorting out the huge variation in the human race is very, very important — and is the future of good medicine,"" Steve Halliwell says. The Halliwells spend the next hour learning about the project and answering detailed questions about their lifestyles, medical history and health. They also get their blood pressure, height, weight and waists measured and have blood drawn so scientists can get a sample of their DNA. Anne Halliwell is 67; Steve is 74. They're white. And that's the problem: White people like the Halliwells are much more likely than black people to volunteer for medical studies. The reasons are complicated. One is that African-Americans may not get the chance as often — they just aren't asked by their doctors or don't have the time or resources to volunteer. But another is that medical research has a long, troubled racial history. One example is the Tusgekee study, which involved doctors letting black men die from syphilis. Another example is the case of Henrietta Lacks. She was a poor African-American woman whose cancer cells scientists and drug companies used for decades without her permission. But the list of abuses is long. So the National Institutes of Health and others have been trying to overcome all that, in part by working with groups like the Abyssinian Baptist Church. ""This research is not like the Tuskegee experiment,"" Butts tells his congregation. ""And it is supported by some members of the Henrietta Lacks family."" ""It's for all ethnicities,"" he says. ""And you can bet your life that white folk are in this. They want to know what's gonna keep 'em alive. And we ought to know what's going to keep us alive."" 
                The Abyssinian Baptist Church partnered with researchers on the All of Us project, allowing them to set up an information table at a block party following a Sunday church service.

 The Abyssinian Baptist Church partnered with researchers on the All of Us project, allowing them to set up an information table at a block party following a Sunday church service. As the service ends and the parishioners file out of the church, they find a block party starting outside. At one of the folding tables lining the block, researchers from the NIH, Columbia and two other New York hospitals are answering questions. ""So what is this?"" one parishioner asks. ""So you're doing research — tell me about this."" ""It's really a unique program,"" says Kolbi Brown, the project's program manager at the Harlem Hospital. ""Our goal is to get participants — a diverse range of participants. So we want women. We want minorities. We want everybody. But we really want women and minorities to participate in this community, of course."" Many people at the block party are enthusiastic. ""I can't wait for this program to start,"" says Joanne Thigpen, who lives in Harlem. ""I'm very excited about it for myself and my children."" But some are wary. Deborah Fleming listens patiently but then declines an invitation to sign up. ""As an African-American, I know that sometimes these things are used against us — not to our advantage,"" says Fleming, who lives in Dutchess County, N.Y. ""So that's why I'm reticent about joining."" 
                Deborah Fleming declined to provide her contact information during the block party. She says she hesitated because of abuses of African-Americans that have occurred during medical research in the past.

 Deborah Fleming declined to provide her contact information during the block party. She says she hesitated because of abuses of African-Americans that have occurred during medical research in the past. Benjamin Vines Jr., 64, who was enjoying the party down the street, has similar feelings. ""It reminds me of the Tuskegee-type thing,"" he says. ""And in my culture, African-Americans are scared of the doctor. They don't go to the doctor until the last minute — until we're almost on our deathbed — simply because of that."" A new poll by NPR, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health found that about a third of African-Americans say they have experienced discrimination at a doctor's office or health clinic. The poll also found that 1 in 5 African-Americans avoids medical care because of concern about discrimination. At first, I thought it was only older parishioners who feel that way. Hortensia Gooding, a 45-year-old graduate student who lives in Harlem, set me straight. ""I see my friends mentioning Tuskegee all the time on Facebook,"" Gooding says. ""There's a lot of deep, deep-seated fear and concern that black lives don't matter and that the medical community really will harm people of African descent on purpose — just for profit or just to help someone from another race."" And some people's reluctance has nothing to do with Tuskegee or Lacks. Don't forget: The study is asking volunteers to give up a sample of their DNA. ""No. Not my DNA — I can't,"" says 51-year-old Clerance Johnson Jr., who also lives in Harlem. ""I don't know what they might use it for,"" he says. ""It might link me to something I don't want to be linked to — any criminal activities."" So the question remains: Will the help of the Abyssinian Baptist Church — and others — be enough to overcome these deep suspicions and other obstacles that prevent minorities from participating in medical research? This story is part of our ongoing series, ""You, Me and Them: Experiencing Discrimination in America."" The series is based in part on a poll by NPR, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. We will be releasing results from other groups — including Latinos, whites, Asian-Americans, Native Americans and LGBTQ adults — over the next several weeks.

npr,"October 26, 2017",Red Cross To Scale Back In Afghanistan," Some people traveled for days across the harsh terrain of northern Afghanistan to reach the orthopedic center only to find its gates closed. Staff and security guards had tried to spread the word that the center was suspending operations after a Spanish physical therapist was gunned down in September, but some never received the devastating news. They stood there in tears, say local staff. The center reopened Tuesday, but the International Committee of the Red Cross is hoping to turn it over to the Afghan government or a local nongovernmental organization — part of a major scaledown in northern Afghanistan. The international group has operated continuously in the country for 30 years. Some of its aid workers have been abducted and killed over that span of time, but the intensity of attacks has stepped up. In the past 11 months, Red Cross workers were targeted three times. Two of the incidents took place while staff members were traveling on the country's dangerous roads. Then came the attack in September that set a new precedent. The incident did not happen on roads where the Red Cross must rely on security guarantees from armed groups. It happened in an orthopedic center, a place where the country's war victims came for 26 years to receive physical therapy, prosthetic limbs and medical treatment along with people with polio, spinal injuries and other issues. On Sept. 11, just days after the release of two abducted staff, a Spanish physiotherapist was treating children with cerebral palsy when a longtime polio patient took out a concealed gun from his wheelchair. The day after the death of Lorena Enebral Perez, the orthopedic center in Mazar-i-Sharif closed for more than a month. ""Immediately from the headquarters in Geneva, we began a discussion and the decision was done,"" says Andrea Catta Preta, the Red Cross head of communications in Afghanistan. Together with the Afghanistan team, the ICRC chose to scale back operations in the north. That decision means fewer services for 700,000 residents — and has rattled other aid groups working in the region. ""We were hit in what is most probably one of the safest places in Afghanistan. Nobody would dare touch them until this fatal day,"" says Thomas Glass, former head of the Red Cross' Afghanistan communications. Two offices — one in Kunduz and another in Maimana — have closed for the foreseeable future. A larger office in Mazar-i-Sharif, known as the nerve center for Red Cross operations in the north, is being significantly downsized over the next few months. Important programs including food distribution to the displaced and the installation of hand pumps for water have ceased. The transport of war victims to health facilities for initial treatment through the Red Cross' driver system has also been suspended. The planned structural repairs at the 150-bed Sheberghan Hospital will be completed, but the Red Cross will no longer provide medical supplies or training staff. Security is tightening at all of the Red Cross' seven orthopedic centers in Afghanistan. There will be more unarmed security guards, metal detectors and a separate area for pat-downs of all visitors. They're covering the inside windows with plastic sheeting so that shards of glass don't go flying in explosions. ""It's a frustrating situation because we know the country; we have all the means to assist the people,"" says Catta Preta. But ""we had no other choice."" The repercussions won't just be felt in the north. ""At this time we're limiting our movements so we're not leaving urban areas, we're not going to rural areas,"" Catta Preta says. All of the trucks delivering food, water, blankets and other provisions to poor communities across the country have stopped. Afghanistan has long been a dangerous place. ISIS, with the help of former Taliban groups, overran a northern district in June. The government controls less than 60 percent of the country, 6 percent less than the same time last year according to U.S. military estimates. Some 8 million people live in contested areas. And years of conflict have fragmented militant groups. ""It's getting more difficult to know who the actors are, where they are, if they have a chain of command. Many of them, they don't,"" says Catta Preta. In a country where 101 aid workers were killed last year, it's a feeling that other aid organizations understand. ""The series of attacks on ICRC in the north have been of great concern to us,"" says Najia Hyder, the regional director of Afghanistan and Pakistan for Mercy Corps. The Portland, Ore.-based organization has operated in Afghanistan for more than 30 years. And they have lost workers too. Fearing the security of their staff, Mercy Corps pulled out a team in Kunduz in September 2015 for a few months until the organization felt the area had stabilized. In Badakhshan, a province in the north, Mercy Corps is engaged in infrastructure projects, including the construction of schools and a health center with OB-GYN and tuberculosis care. After construction is complete, the community and government take control. Hyder says there have been no plans to reduce their operations — but that could change at any minute. She says, ""For security management, it's a day-to-day decision-making."" The Red Cross will continue to facilitate visits and phone calls between families and their imprisoned relatives. Afghans show up describing how a family member went missing or was detained; then staffers track the person down by contacting detention centers. But people who relied on these services in Kunduz and Maimana will now have to travel up to nine hours to Kabul just to make a 20-minute phone call to an imprisoned family member. Across the country, ICRC has 1,800 local hires and close to 120 foreign workers. Some 100 local Afghan staff will gradually be laid off, and about 30 of the international staff will leave the country. Catta Preta says the organization is preparing a human resources package for those who lose their job and will help try to place them with other institutions. ""I think we've reached a point where the Afghan population is almost beyond anger,"" says the Red Cross' Glass of the current situation. ""It almost reaches a point where they lose hope."" In the past few weeks, he says, Afghans would come up to him to apologize profusely: ""They want us to know that this is not the true Afghanistan. But in a way, there is desperation because it feels like this is what Afghanistan is becoming.""

npr,"October 26, 2017","Wake Up, Sleepy Ikea Shoppers!"," And then there are the Shanghai seniors who went on group blind dates in the well-lit canteen without ordering anything — not even the Swedish meatballs. They'd sit and chat for hours, while other customers were holding food trays and yet couldn't find a seat. Ikea's Shanghai outpost in Xuhui district asked people who brought their own snacks and drink and held the seats for too long to buy something from the cafeteria before being seated. That plan didn't work out either. Some would just buy a croissant — paying the equivalent of 60 cents — so they could enjoy the canteen facilities. And now the nappers have a nemesis. This month, a comedian who goes by the name of Longge (literal translation: ""the Dragon Brother"") posted videos on his YouTube channel in which he and his friends wake up random people who are sleeping in Ikea showrooms. In the video, they pretend they're customers checking out products in the bedroom displays. When they encounter a sleeper, they snatch the duvet, grab the pillow, pull up the mattress and even lie down with the sleeper. ""You can't see I'm sound asleep?"" says one gray-haired man napping on a sofa. ""You people are so uncivilized."" The five-minute video has received more than 30,000 likes and 5,500 comments on Weibo, the Chinese equivalent to Twitter. Most of the netizens say Longge did a great job, and Ikea should do something about people who nap on furniture displays. Only a few people say Longge went a little too far. ""Some people might be just very tired,"" says a netizen. ""Some workers don't own a place in the city. What's the problem of taking a little nap there during lunch break?"" The Swedish retailer opened its first store in China in 1998, when the Chinese middle class had just started to grow. Ikea had a tough time drawing Chinese customers, who considered the Nordic brand a luxury that's out of their reach. To cater to the Chinese market, Ikea has lowered prices by half over the past decade and encouraged people to try out products and make themselves at home. In 2015, a spokeswoman for Ikea China told the Wall Street Journal that they do encourage Chinese customers to touch and try products. Maybe that's why people nap comfortably and children play with sample toys in the kids' section. One couple even stayed overnight and livestreamed a hide-and-seek game (although without Ikea's permission). And Ikea gets what it wanted: a quick expansion in the country. There are 24 stores so far, and in 2016 customers spent almost $2 billion in the food department alone. And everybody knows that a big meal can make you sleepy. We're all neighbors on our tiny globe.

npr,"October 25, 2017",What's The Meaning Of The World Bank's New Poverty Lines?," The 767 million people in that category have $1.90 a day or less in purchasing power to fulfill their daily needs. Most of that money goes for food – only it may not be enough to purchase nutritious food or to stave off hunger. Hundreds of millions of the extreme poor are malnourished. Their housing may be of low quality. And they may not have enough money for school fees (primary education isn't always free) or health-care expenses. Millions of the extremely poor live in the world's low-income countries. But here's a surprising fact: Well over half of the extremely poor live in middle income countries like India, Nigeria and China. And here's another point to consider: You can have more than $1.90 a day to spend on the basic necessities and still live in relative poverty. As the World Bank puts it in a poverty FAQ: ""Not surprisingly, richer countries tend to have higher poverty lines, while poorer countries have lower poverty lines."" That's why the World Bank has come up with two new ""poverty line"" figures for the world's middle-income countries: $3.20 a day for lower middle income nations (like Egypt, India and the Philippines) and $5.50 a day for upper middle income nations (like Brazil, Jamaica and South Africa). Loading... The idea is that the new numbers offer a better way to measure poverty in middle-income countries. ""These new numbers are closer to the individual country's national poverty lines,"" says Homi Kharas, senior fellow and co-director of the Global Economy and Development Program at the Brookings Institution. They represent a ""fixed benchmark to judge whether poverty is going up or going down in the world"" – and for middle-income countries to see how they're doing. Of course, it's natural to be a bit befuddled about the meaning of these new figures. ""The challenge the World Bank has is to make sure people don't get confused,"" says Kharas. In a nutshell, there's extreme poverty ... and just plain poverty. ""If you're living in shantytown slums around Lima with no basic services and scraping to get basic subsistence, you would say, 'Yeah, I'm poor,' — even though the World Bank might measure your income at $4 a day,"" says Justin Sandefur, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development. He also notes that ""there almost isn't anyone in middle-income countries as poor as the most people in Ethiopia."" As for efforts to help the world's extreme poor — there's good news on that front. Between 1990 and 2013, the number of people living on $1.90 a day or less has been cut roughly in half. The United Nations has committed to ending extreme poverty as one of its Sustainable Development Goals, an ambitious set of 17 targets for the world to reach by 2030. But that doesn't mean poverty will vanish. The new poverty line numbers serve as a reminder, says Sandefur, that even though extreme poverty is declining, ""we still have deep, intractable pockets of poverty in many countries.""

npr,"October 25, 2017",Alexis Okeowo Finds God In The Brave Acts Of Ordinary Africans," Journalist Alexis Okeowo spent years reporting in Africa — and quickly grew fatigued with the common narrative: stories of victimhood, hopelessness, chaos and despair. In her new book, A Moonless, Starless Sky, the 2006 Princeton University grad writes instead about ordinary Africans who are standing up to extremism, people who are in their own ways resisting religious and cultural fundamentalism in acts of everyday bravery. NPR's Melissa Block spoke with Okeowo, a staff writer at The New Yorker. Here's their discussion, edited for clarity and length. Ordinary Women and Men Fighting Extremism in Africa by Alexis Okeowo Hardcover, 240 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? The thread connecting the chapters of your book is resistance, based on your reporting on the ground in Uganda, Somalia, Nigeria, Mauritania. Why did you come to focus on that? I realized over the years reporting in Africa that my reporting was starting to follow a pattern. I was seeking out people who found themselves, suddenly, in extreme situations. And I was interested in what kind of choices they made, and how they rose to the occasion, and how they tried to preserve their ways of life amid circumstances that were extraordinary. And in all of these situations — whether it was dealing with terrorism or conflict or a failed state — all of the subjects fought back in their own ways and in order to protect their families, or to keep playing sports, or to keep loving who they wanted to love. And, so, I was drawn to those everyday acts of resistance and drawn to [people who] made often simple — but incredibly brave — choices to keep their lives intact. Let's talk about the couple you described from Uganda, Eunice and Bosco, who were captured by Joseph Kony's Lord's Resistance Army when they were teenagers, both forced to commit unspeakable atrocities in the bush. Eunice is taken by Bosco to be his ""bush wife"" as it's called. He rapes her on their first night as a couple. But years later, they both escape. They return home. And Eunice chooses to stay with Bosco as a married couple, raising their children together. How does she explain that decision? You know, that was a very difficult story to report because I wanted to let her tell me in her own words why she decided to stay with a man who had done something horrible to her. But in the end, what she realized and what she told me is that both of them were victims of their circumstances. Both of them were victims of a rebel group that tried to tear them from everything they had known, from the idea of family, from the idea of love. And the truth was, she told me that she had grown close to this man. She had grown to depend on him, to trust him, eventually to love him. And she realized that the idea of perpetrator and victim is not so clear cut. It's not so easy. You know, when you're dealing with people who were abducted to commit atrocities, were forced to commit atrocities but who didn't want to do it, where's the line? What can you call good and evil? And, so, she did recognize that her family, her community were bewildered. You know, why go back to this man you were forced to be with? But for her, loving was an act of resistance. It was a way to stake a claim on what she felt dear, her family. And it was a way to take control of her life after so much had been controlled for her and decided for her by this rebel group. And they survived together because of each other. Yes, yes. Your book ends on an inspiring note in Somalia with a remarkable young woman named Aisha who has an idol, somebody that she thinks is magic. Who is her idol? It's LeBron James. She's a basketball player? Yeah, she's a basketball player. And she said there's this one guy my neighbor told me about. I didn't know who she was going to say. I thought maybe someone in Somalia. And she said, do you know this guy LeBron James? And like, yeah, I've heard of him. I think I know that guy. Yeah — and Aisha's incredible. She is a teenager, a Somali teenage girl who plays basketball despite death threats to her life. Just for playing a sport, for playing basketball? Exactly. I mean, Somalia is a young country. And even just as recently as 30 years ago, Somalia had an incredibly strong women's basketball team. Women on the team went around with afros and even played in shorts. But with the advent of the civil war two decades ago and increasing radicalism, the entrance of al-Shabab, the restrictions for women have only increased. Their freedoms have shrunk. And, so, even though Aisha's mom used to play basketball and play it freely, nowadays to do that is something that is incredibly defiant. Aisha's not an activist. And she's not trying to be a hero. But she just loves the sport. She loves the game. And she feels it's her right to play. And you know, she's religious to a certain extent, too. And she says she doesn't feel like her God wouldn't want her to play basketball as long as she tries to be faithful and good. One great thing I noticed is that under her long skirts, she'll always be wearing track pants, you know, always ready to kind of whip off her skirt and start playing ball. And when she goes to and from the court, she does hide her team's shirt in her bag. But otherwise, she feels like — this is my life and I should be able to live it like I want to. Is she afraid? She is afraid. And I think that, ultimately — she has told me that if she did have a choice even though she loves her country, she would love to try living in a place where she didn't have all these risks and restrictions. But she kind of tries to power through it because if people see her as being weak and afraid that puts her at even more risk — and she doesn't want to be seen as being vulnerable. So she puts on this bravado. In your book, you write: ""For years, I'd been asking where God was in the conflicts and crimes I had reported on in Africa."" Are you any closer now to an answer to that question? I do think I am because I think it is in people like this, the people I wrote about. Because I couldn't see God in the horrible atrocities I was witnessing. I just couldn't see any kind of order or righteousness or logic behind that. But I could see faith and good in these flawed people that I was writing about who were all religious in themselves and all had religion as a steadying, supportive force in their lives that enabled them to either resist in overt ways or to just do simple things — like going to the [basketball] court like Aisha in Somalia or choosing to be with her partner like Eunice in Uganda. I could see God there in people, who I'm not saying are heroes or were perfect but who found in religion something supportive and something fortifying that helped them live their lives and resist.

npr,"October 24, 2017",VIDEOS: Look Who's Talking About Polio Over A Cup Of Coffee," Perhaps the creators were inspired by Jerry Seinfeld's ""Comedians ... Getting Coffee"" — not that there's anything wrong with that. Since 2016, five installments have aired with different polio experts. And yes, they do sip coffee. But they're talking about serious stuff. In one interview, Dr. Ousmane Diop, coordinator of WHO's Global Polio Laboratory Network, talks about new, smarter ways to track polio — like testing the sewage system to see if there's polio virus in the area. If someone has the polio virus, he explains, it will show up in their feces. In another, Pakistani Senator Ayesha Raza Farooq, the prime minister's Focal Person on Polio Eradication in Pakistan, talks about eradication efforts in her country. Pakistan is one of the few countries with polio cases. The videos might be lower-budget but there's plenty of drama. Farooq tells how female health workers on the front lines ""brave all kinds of odds, whether it's rough terrain, adverse weather conditions, security challenges, to keep our children safe from a disease like polio."" WHO communications officer Oliver Rosenbauer explains that he does administrative work in Geneva, but always loved when his colleagues who work in the field would come back and recount their experiences over a cup of coffee or tea. ""They are true heroes in my mind,"" Rosenbauer writes in an email, ""almost a little like Indiana Jones of the medical field."" That's how he came up with the idea for the series. He writes, ""I just thought I would still have coffee (or tea) with them, get them to tell their stories, and film it so that others can also get the benefit of hearing about those experiences."" Carol Pandak, director of Rotary International's PolioPlus was the first to be interviewed. She talked about how her organization has been recognized as the first organization to ""have a vision of a polio-free world."" Her appearance ""got a lot of good comments,"" she says, ""In fact, one of my Rotary members just sent me a note today that she has watched all of the series and has learned a lot about polio."" But there is one concern: Does the show live up to its title? In some segments, including the most recent interview with Dr. Naveed Sadozai, a retired epidemiologist from Pakistan, the interviewer appears to be drinking ... tea?

npr,"October 22, 2017",How Widows Find Their Path To Healing In Zimbabwe," Mukwavaya is still heartbroken, both because she never had the chance to say goodbye — and because of what happened next. Mukwavaya, who lives in Harare, Zimbabwe, says her husband went missing in January 2014. He was found drowned in a well three days later. Authorities suspected that he committed suicide. Her in-laws did not agree: ""His relatives began to accuse me of killing him, saying I had done it to take ownership of the house,"" she says. The accusations worsened her grief. ""I was in so much pain, asking why he had to commit suicide,"" she says. ""But there was no one to give me the answers."" Losing a spouse or another loved one is a painful experience everywhere – the best-selling book that Facebook executive Sheryl Sandberg wrote after the death of her husband, looks at how Americans cope with, as the title states: Option B: Facing Adversity, Building Resilience, and Finding Joy. In Zimbabwe, comfort comes from a mix of local customs and communal empathy. Mukwavaya left the funeral before her husband was buried — the early departure is to ensure that the spirit of her late husband does not follow her. But because of the increasing tension with her in-laws, she left even earlier than is customary, before she could complete rituals meant to set his spirit free. This left her without closure, she says. But she later performed a ritual she found helpful: ""I was instructed to take the water I had bathed with and my undergarment and throw them into a river,"" she says. ""I was told this was a process of separating myself from him to ensure that his spirit does not torment me."" Mukwavaya says the support of her family along with the traditional rituals helped make her strong. ""I feel I am stronger than before and I can face anything because I managed to survive the moment that I thought would break me,"" she says. Her situation — blamed by her late husband's family but comforted by the community — is not unusual in Zimbabwe. ""In situations where you have unresolved issues, it is very easy to blame the woman,"" says Dr. Dixon Chibanda, a psychiatrist affiliated with Harrare Central Hospital and the director of the African Mental Research Initiative. Because women are ""to some extent still disenfranchised in this part of the world,"" he notes, ""the woman may be accused or blamed for the death of the husband."" He recalls a case where a woman left her husband because he was having an extra-marital affair. The husband committed suicide, ""actually shot himself,"" says Dixon. ""In the eyes of the family it's her responsibility. But the larger community understood the pain she was going through."" They did not blame her. ""The irony of it all,"" he says, ""is that when someone dies"" — even when there are accusations leveled at the widow by the husband's family — ""there is usually a lot of support from the entire community."" The community believes that it's important for widows to speak openly about their grief in church settings and with neighbors. Health authorities are also experimenting with programs that offer grief counseling in public spaces. Chibanda says there are innovative support systems in Harare, Zimbabwe's capital, like the Friendship Bench, an organization he created to help people, including those who have lost loved ones, fight depression. When a grieving person visits the Friendship Bench — which is quite literally a park bench — they speak with trained lay health workers employed by the city's health authorities, Chibanda says. ""In 2016, more than 30,000 people came to the Friendship Bench to seek services, and about 20 percent of these people had lost their loved ones,"" he says. Siphathiso Mpofu, 46, lost her husband in February 2016 to liver cancer. She says there were many community support systems for her. ""I got comfort from the church through counseling from pastors. They would visit me at home and we would pray together,"" she says. ""Family members would come at regular intervals."" The community took steps to ensure the grieving widow wasn't alone. ""One of my neighbors gave me his daughter to stay with for about a month after my husband died, so that l would not be lonely,"" Mpofu says. The widow eases back into life according to local traditions. ""One has to wait for a period of one year before they engage in any sexual relationship with someone else, and they can only do so after cleansing ceremony,"" Mpofu says. After a year, there is a cleansing ceremony, where women are ""required to jump a knobkerrie,"" a short stick with a rounded top, ""to show that she has not engaged in any sexual relationship during that period,"" says Prince Sibanda, a traditional healer. Dr. Sekai Martha Nhiwatiwa, a psychiatrist based in Harare, says that while local culture is rich with traditions and support systems for the bereaved, some local customs are challenging during the grieving process. ""Crying is actually very good, but in our culture people say the grieving should not cry because it will lead others to cry,"" she says. ""But l encourage people to cry to deal with grief.""

npr,"October 20, 2017","Troubled By Flint Water Crisis, 11-Year-Old Girl Invents Lead-Detecting Device"," When the drinking water in Flint, Mich., became contaminated with lead, causing a major public health crisis, 11-year-old Gitanjali Rao took notice. ""I had been following the Flint, Michigan, issue for about two years,"" the seventh-grader told ABC News. ""I was appalled by the number of people affected by lead contamination in water."" She saw her parents testing the water in their own home in Lone Tree, Colo., and was unimpressed by the options, which can be slow, unreliable or both. ""I went, 'Well, this is not a reliable process and I've got to do something to change this,' "" Rao told Business Insider. Rao tells ABC that while she was doing her weekly perusal of MIT's Materials Science and Engineering website to see ""if there's anything's new,"" she read about new technologies that could detect hazardous substances and decided to see whether they could be adapted to test for lead. She pressed local high schools and universities to give her lab time and then hunkered down in the ""science room"" — outfitted with a big white table — that she persuaded her engineer parents to create in their home. And she set about devising a more efficient solution: a device that could identify lead compounds in water and was portable and relatively inexpensive. As she explains at lightning speed in her video submission for the Discovery Education 3M Young Scientist Challenge, her device consists of three parts. There is a disposable cartridge containing chemically treated carbon nanotube arrays, an Arduino-based signal processor with a Bluetooth attachment, and a smartphone app that can display the results. Here is how it works. The carbon nanotubes in the cartridge are sensitive to changes in the flow of electrons. Those tubes are lined with atoms that have an affinity to lead, which adds a measurable resistance to the electron flow. When the cartridge is dipped in water that is clean, the electron flow doesn't change and the smartphone app shows that water is safe to drink. But when the cartridge is dipped in contaminated water, the lead in the water reacts to the atoms, causing resistance in the electron flow that is measured by the Arduino processor. The app then shows that the water isn't safe to drink. Rao dubbed the device Tethys, for the Greek goddess of fresh water. ""Clean water always tastes good,"" she says at the end of her video. ""The tool allows easy testing at home or by agencies for quick detection and remedial actions. It can be expanded in the future to test for other chemical contaminants in potable water. I hope this helps in a small way to detect and prevent long-term health effects of lead contamination for many of us.""

 To make her device, Rao pressed local high schools and universities to give her lab time and then hunkered down in the ""science room"" — outfitted with a big white table — that she persuaded her engineer parents to create in their home in Lone Tree, Colo. Her solution was so ingenious that this week, Rao was named ""America's Top Young Scientist"" in the Discovery Education 3M Young Scientist Challenge — a distinction that comes with a check for $25,000. For the past three months, Rao and nine other finalists in the competition had been paired with scientists at 3M who helped them work from a theoretical concept to a physical prototype. Rao was matched with Kathleen Shafer, a research specialist who develops new plastics technologies. Rao plans to save some of the prize money for college but use the rest to invest in her device to make it commercially viable. ""It's not hyperbole to say she really blew us out of the water,"" Brian Barnhart, a school superintendent in Illinois and one of the judges, told ABC. ""The other nine kids, they were also such amazing kids, so for her to stand out the way she did with a peer group like this is like an exclamation point on top of it."" Rao says that when she grows up, she would like to be a geneticist or epidemiologist. Her lead detection device allowed her to combine both interests, as contaminated water can cause both rashes and birth defects. ""I studied a little bit of both of these topics since I was really interested in these fields,"" she told Business Insider, ""and then I came up with this device to help save lives.""

npr,"October 20, 2017",Nivea Ad For 'Visibly Fairer Skin' Sparks Controversy In West Africa," Dove isn't the only skin-care company caught up in a controversy about its ads. Nivea, a German company with global reach, has been called out on social media for ads in West Africa that many described as racist, colorist and tone-deaf. The ads promote Natural Fairness Body Lotion, a cream that promises, according to the tagline, ""visibly fairer skin."" The social media storm erupted after the Ghanaian musician Fuse ODG posted the ad on Instagram this week. For those of u claiming the word ""fairer"" mean beautifulTakeDown ya SelfHate billboards in Africa. #BlackIsBeautiful@Nivea_UK @NiveaUSA pic.twitter.com/zclNxARveE The ads themselves have been around for a few months. They first appeared on billboards in Lagos, Abuja and Port Harcourt, Nigeria, in June. Former Nigerian beauty queen Omowunmi Akinnifesi is featured, gazing into space, a sly smile playing on the sides of her lips. There's a TV commercial as well in which Akinnifesi's skin progressively lightens as she applies Nivea's product to her body. ""I saw the Nivea ad once. It was after a long day, I'd been out on field assignments, and my skin had darkened by a shade, as it does when I stay outdoors for extended periods,"" says Ria Evbuoma, a medical doctor based in Lagos. ""After the ad, I honestly took a look at my arms. I was darker, today. Do I need to be fairer?"" This ad campaign subsequently was taken to Cameroon, Ghana and Senegal. There's been particularly severe criticism in Ghana, with several social media users calling for a boycott of Nivea products and for the ads to be pulled, using the #pullitdownnow hashtag. Ghana has had an ongoing conversation about skin tones — and lightening products — for a while now. Last year, the government banned creams that contain hydroquinone because of possible links between the bleaching agent and health issues. ""The first time I saw the ad, I thought it was problematic,"" recalls Ayodeji Rotinwa, a journalist based in Nigeria. ""Omowunmi Akinnifesi is not that fair to begin with. But in my opinion, for someone who girls look up to and isn't too fair or too dark, to then come out and say, 'fairer is better!' ... people already aspire to be like you."" Akinnifesi, who first came into the limelight in 2005 after winning the Most Beautiful Girl in Nigeria pageant, has enjoyed public goodwill and is one of the leading faces in the country's fashion and beauty industry. She has yet to speak about the social media uproar. ""What was wrong with Ms. Akinnifesi's skin anyway?"" Evbuoma asks rhetorically. ""I think that [the ad] strengthens the stereotype that happiness, fulfilment, career advancement and other positives are directly linked to skin tone."" Nivea's response: ""We have recently noted concerns on social media by some consumers regarding our NIVEA Natural Fairness Body Lotion communication in Ghana. We would like to emphasise that this campaign is in no way meant to demean or glorify any person's needs or preferences in skin care."" The statement also said that the product is meant to ""protect the skin from long-term sun damage and premature skin-ageing"" and also address ""uneven skin tone"" — and that it is ""every consumer's right to choose products according to their personal preferences."" This social media criticism of Nivea's ad is part of an ongoing debate in Africa, where there is growing dissent against skin lightening products, popularly called ""bleaching creams"" in Nigeria. But unlike the Dove soap ads, in which a black woman took off her shirt and morphed into a white woman, critics don't necessarily use the word ""racist"" to describe the Nivea campaign. In the countries where the ads appeared, nearly everyone is of the same race. So the term more often used was ""colorist"" — an attempt to perpetuate a belief that light skin tones are better than dark skin. For some Nigerians, ""good skin is usually fair skin,"" says Rotinwa. ""It is sort of an indirect colonial legacy, a byproduct of colonialism."" And if you think that ""power belongs to people who are fairer, who are lighter, why not then look like them?"" Sadly, this is a worldwide pathology, created by colonialism, exploited by marketers. https://t.co/OB2PtJrO6N There's even a word in Nigerian slang, Rotinwa says — oyinbo – that can mean anything from a light-skinned person to a Caucasian. ""Oyinbo is supposedly better,"" says Rotinwa. ""Oyinbo is a good thing. Oyinbo is something we should aspire to. And oyinbo is the standard worldwide."" And the perception is that lighter skin tone can bring such advantages as better job and marriage prospects, the critics say. Looooooool. Tone deaf to who? If anything they are listening to us. We scream loudly about our demand. https://t.co/NVGvsGmFd4 The perception is that ""the darker and more 'African' you are, the less likely you will gain privilege based on your looks,"" says Edwin Okolo, an editor and fashion designer. ""Buying creams seems like a relatively easy way to a better life."" And the skin lightening products are popular. According to a 2002 survey of 450 residents of Lagos, done by the University of Cape Town, an estimated 77 percent use them. Cancelling Nivea won't change the fact that there are people actively seeking bleaching products.That's what is really concerning. One of the most widely read books in Nigeria, The Secret Lives of Baba Segi's Wives — a humorous narrative set in the ancient city of Ibadan, some miles away from Lagos — features a character, Iya Femi, a sassy and opportunistic woman, who bleaches her skin. The bleaching doesn't go well; her skin tone becomes irregular and spotted. Still Iya Femi is incredibly proud of the light skin color. ""She did it because she thought that was beauty,"" says author Lola Shoneyin. That hasn't always been the case, Shoneyin adds. ""The way we look at people that bleached their skin in 2017 is very different from the way my mother will talk about women who use all these creams — I mean am talking 25, 30 years ago. Not that it wasn't acceptable but people who bleached their skin were regarded as women who were trying too hard to get attention.""

npr,"October 20, 2017",Webcast: Can The World Finally Wipe Out Polio?," ""We hope to completely eliminate transmission during the current low transmission season, which starts from September and ends in May,"" he says. ""We are very confident we can do this. But the last mile is always very difficult."" Pakistan has been holding national polio immunization days in which a quarter of a million vaccinators attempt to make sure 38 million children get all three doses of the oral polio vaccine. ""We must reach these children from the coast of Karachi to the mountains in the highest part of Pakistan,"" Dr. Rana says. If polio transmission is stopped in Pakistan and neighboring Afghanistan, it would be a major milestone in public health. Assuming the virus doesn't manage to take root elsewhere, polio would be only the second human disease to be eradicated after smallpox. And virologists say smallpox was a far easier target than polio. With smallpox if someone was infectious they were also visibly ill. Polio on the other hand can be spread by people who show no signs of being sick. The polio virus can also hide in and spread through sewage. With smallpox, officials just needed to contain the virus at the sick patients' beds. Polio is far more wily. A global plan to eradicate polio launched in 1988 set an eradication date of the year 2000. The program made incredible progress, dropping the number of cases year from more than 300,000 worldwide to just 11 today. But the eradication program has cost billions of dollars and has struggled to deal the virus a decisive fatal blow. In 2014 Africa appeared to be polio free only to have the paralytic disease pop back up in Nigeria two years later. The last case reported in Africa (or for that matter anywhere other than in Pakistan or Afghanistan) was in more than a year ago in Nigeria. Cases of vaccine-derived polio have re-emerged in Syria and other conflict zones. As long as the live vaccine is still being used, the potential for vaccine-derived cases remain. These cases stem from strains of the oral vaccine that have mutated and regained strength in the environment. But the plan is to stop using the live, oral vaccine as soon as wild polio is wiped out. At that point the whole world would exclusively be using an injectable vaccine that doesn't contain live virus. Dr. Rana in Pakistan is confident that that day is coming soon. Polio, he says, is in its last days and will soon be wiped out. ""We are sure we will meet our goal very soon,"" he says. Originally Pakistan had set that goal as 2016. Earlier the Global Polio Eradication Initiative had set the year 2000 as the target for polio's demise. Despite those missed deadlines, the number of polio cases globally is at an all-time low and the world appears closer to being polio-free than ever before. On Friday, NPR and The Forum at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health presented a discussion with polio experts: ""Eradicating Polio: Reaching the Last Child."" The panelists talked about how the world has come so close to this ""last mile"" of polio eradication and what steps need to be taken to end transmission.

npr,"October 19, 2017","Report: Pollution Kills 3 Times More than AIDS, TB And Malaria Combined"," Exposure to polluted air, water and soil caused nine million premature deaths in 2015, according to a report published Thursday in The Lancet.  The causes of death vary — cancer, lung disease, heart disease. The report links them to pollution, drawing upon previous studies that show how pollution is tied to a wider range of diseases than previously thought. Those studies observed populations exposed to pollutants and compared them to people not exposed. The studies have shown that pollution can be an important cause of diseases — many of them potentially fatal — including asthma, cancer, neurodevelopmental disorders, birth defects in children, heart disease, stroke and lung disease. Loading... The nine million figure adds up to 16 percent of all deaths worldwide, killing three times more people than AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria combined. Pollution is responsible for 15 times more deaths than wars and all other forms of violence. ""No country is unaffected,"" the report notes. But 92 percent of those deaths occurred in low- and middle-income countries. ""Pollution in rapidly developing countries is just getting worse and worse and worse. And it isn't getting the attention it deserves. It needed to be rigorously studied,"" says Dr. Philip Landrigan, pediatrician and professor of environmental medicine and global health at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. He is the lead author of the Lancet Commission on Pollution and Health along with Richard Fuller, president of Pure Earth, which works to clean up pollution in poor countries. We talked with Landrigan about the commission's findings. Why do this study now? The issue has come of age. Richard Fuller and I have worked in environmental health for a long time. Richard works with USAID and counterparts to clean up hazardous waste. I'm a pediatrician studying effects of pollution on health. We have deep roots in this area. We wanted to rigorously study the problem and marshal the evidence. We brought in these authors with a range of expertise to work on a report to try to translate science into policy. We wanted to look at disease, but also the intersection of pollution with economics and social injustice. The report says that ""the health-related costs of pollution are hidden in hospital budgets."" What do mean by hidden costs?  Say a person comes into the hospital with cardiac arythmia. Nobody makes the connection that it happened on a day when air pollution was extremely high. Rates of heart disease and stroke are kicked up by air pollution. [Inhaled nanoparticles of pollution can play a role in rupturing plaque build-up in arteries, causing a heart attack or stroke, according to the American Heart Association.] Arsenic in the water increases rates of some cancers, but the connection isn't immediate. When debates arise about controlling pollution, industry almost always says it's too expensive to make changes. Industries can make that statement because they can calculate how much it costs, say, to put filters on smokestacks. The health costs to people over many years of exposure to pollution is less obvious. Why does pollution disproportionately affect poor countries? Many of those countries are rapidly industrializing. But they have weak environmental agencies. They're galloping ahead with industrialization without paying attention to the consequences. You talk about environmental injustice. Explain the injustice of pollution. One blatant example is asbestos. About two million tons of new asbestos is produced every year. [Asbestos is outlawed in most of the developed world because of the high risk of lung cancer.] Virtually all of that goes to the world's poorest countries that have poor or no regulations against it. [According to reports it is used in the production of building materials, among other products.] It's going to continue to cause epidemics of cancer in poor counties. Another example is pesticides. About 20 percent of U.S. pesticide production is of pesticides not allowed in this country because of known health risks. So we export it to poor countries. Then there is the international transfer of materials like old computers, cell phones, TVs, refrigerators from rich countries to the developing world. People break them up and try to extract valuable things like gold or copper, and pollutants get into the soil. Or lead batteries end up in developing countries and contaminate communities. Are there low- or middle-income countries that are making positive changes regarding pollution? China is doing a very good job in controlling their pollution. They still have a long way to go but they have a national plan for attacking air, water and soil pollution and they're becoming a world leader in the adoption of renewable energy — wind and solar. What are the next steps? We suggest creating a Global Pollution Observatory to track progress toward tackling pollution and periodically publishing updates in The Lancet. Also, experts in developed countries can provide technical assistance to poor countries to develop and implement health and pollution action plans like reporting statistics on premature deaths by pollution risk factor. In fact, that work has already started in Madagascar, Thailand and Kenya. And we've launched an interactive websitea step toward tracking progress on global pollution. It seems like an enormous problem. Do you see much hope for reducing pollution-related disease and deaths in poor countries? One of the things we hope will happen is that pollution will become more important on the global policy agenda. When you look at the time in the U.S. since 1970, the year of the passage of the Clean Air Act, air pollution in the U.S. has come down by 70 percent. At the same time, GDP has increased by 250 percent. That puts the lie to what we hear that controlling pollution is going to kill jobs. That's untrue. The laws, the engineering solutions, are ready to be exported. This is a winnable battle. We say that because the rich countries have done it. In 1969, the Cuyahoga River in Cleveland was so polluted, it caught fire. Today, people kayak down that river. Susan Brink is a freelance writer who covers health and medicine.

npr,"October 17, 2017",Why World Hunger Isn't Going Away As Fast As We'd Hoped," Rob Vos has been tracking global hunger for years, and he says until recently the mood among his fellow hunger experts was almost giddy. Since 1990 the world had made so much progress curbing hunger that in 2015, leaders met at the United Nations and vowed to eliminate hunger for good by 2030. ""We actually were saying, well, there's still some hurdles, but we can do this. We can end hunger within our generation,"" says Vos, formerly a key official at the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization and now with the International Food Policy Research Institute in Washington, D.C. But while at first glance the global trend lines still look promising, Vos says a closer look at the statistics reveals stubborn problems that threaten that rosy picture. Increasingly this year, he says, cracks are starting to show. Take the latest data: an annual Global Hunger Index produced by IFPRI that rates countries on several criteria measuring both general undernourishment and child malnutrition. For several decades the world has made impressive strides. The share of people who don't get enough to eat dropped from about one-fourth in 1990 to fewer than one-eighth today. And taken on a global scale, an update released this month shows that the numbers have improved at the same steady clip as always. But look at the nation-by-nation statistics, and worrying signs emerge, says Vos. Based on a country's score IFPRI classifies its severity of hunger in categories ranging from low to moderate to serious, alarming and extremely alarming. ""There are actually quite a few countries that are in serious risk of hunger or alarming states of hunger,"" he says. Fifty-two of 106 countries for which data are available, to be precise. Not to mention an additional nine countries, including Somalia, for which complete data were not available but that still raise ""significant concern."" Joining Somalia among the worst off: South Sudan, Yemen and Nigeria, where early this year the U.N. declared that a total of 20 million people in the four countries were at risk of famine. In these countries violent conflict is mainly driving the food crisis. In others the problem is weather disasters, possibly fueled by climate change. And in some nations, such as Madagascar and Zambia, the overwhelming challenge is widespread extreme rural poverty. Even in regions such as Latin America that do well overall, there are glaring exceptions, like Venezuela, where political turmoil and economic mismanagement have created massive price inflation and food shortages, leading IFPRI to classify it at ""moderate"" risk of hunger. National numbers can look overly positive as well, masking deep pockets of deprivation within countries. For too long, says Vos, the top-line good news has distracted policymakers from the underlying bad news. But he says the declaration of famine in so many countries early this year has helped pierce the bubble. Last month brought another troubling milestone. The U.N. announced that for the first time in years, the absolute number of people without enough food — as opposed to the percentage — actually went up in 2016, to 815 million. Vos is hoping this drumbeat of evidence will serve as a wake-up call. ""If we don't do a lot more, then this goal of ending hunger will not be met. Not even close.""

npr,"October 17, 2017",Fear Of Toxic Smog Leads India To Limit Diwali Fireworks," India is set to celebrate Diwali this week, but the Indian capital could be in for a different sort of celebration. Once illuminated with clay lamps, the festival of lights has morphed into a festival of sound and fury. It's estimated some 50,000 tons of fireworks are exploded during Diwali, which marks the homecoming of the Hindu god Lord Ram from exile. But a public health alarm was sounded in Delhi after Diwali last year, when a toxic haze blanketed the city for days. Delhi's air quality is extremely poor: A 2015 study found that half of the city's 4.4 million schoolchildren have diminished lung capacity. To control the escalating pollution, the Supreme Court banned the sale of fireworks during this year's Diwali. (The use of fireworks, though, was not banned.) The ban on sales extends until Nov. 1 to allow the court to fully monitor its impact in the wake of the festival.

 A worker prepares firecrackers at a workshop on the outskirts of Ahmedabad. Heading into this week of celebration, pyrotechnic wholesalers in Delhi's old city section sit in front of their shuttered stores and warily eye anyone who might be a plainclothes cop enforcing the ban. Merchant Praveen Kumar complains that his livelihood is going up in smoke. ""It's 100 percent correct that we are adding to pollution. But the government says it's only three percent of the total — the other 97 percent isn't addressed,"" he says. ""Besides, what do we tell the kids on Diwali: 'Go pray, eat your food and go to bed?' How will they enjoy that?"" Hina Shrivastav's family has peddled fireworks and firecrackers for generations. He calls the ban an assault on tradition. ""It's one of the biggest festivals of Hindus. And in Diwali if there are no crackers, then Diwali doesn't mean anything — only lights and sweets. It's too boring!"" he exclaims. Some traders accused the court of bias against Hindus for singling out their festival, an argument that anguished the court. It said the ban was imposed to safeguard the public's health. Other traders asked why farmers burning crop stubble on land just outside Delhi weren't penalized, or why diesel vehicles belching toxins weren't banned. Jyoti Pande Lavakare, co-founder of the citizen advocacy group Care for Air, says the court is considering all factors. But in tackling fireworks that contain hazardous chemicals, she says the judges took the easiest issue first. And she notes the foul air extends far beyond Delhi. ""Everywhere there are polluted cities in India that are equally, if not more, polluted,"" she says. ""Not just firecrackers but all these other measures should be imposed pan-India. This is not about Delhi, this is about the whole country."" Delhi-ites who bought fireworks before the ban will be free to fire them, though there are expected to be many fewer. That's welcome news for Radha Singh, 60, who is unusually exposed to the high pollution levels that cause significant health impacts. She taps her chest and says she's very ill. ""I fall sick every Diwali,"" she says. ""I can't tolerate the smoke. I've no money for a doctor or medicine."" Singh also says she has no home. ""All I can do is lie down at my place,"" she says, and points to a tree along the roadside. We're all neighbors on our tiny globe. The poor and the rich and everyone in between.

npr,"October 16, 2017",How White Cane Day Makes A Difference," He strolls past a golden pagoda. He taps his white cane back and forth on the pavement, making sure to avoid the potholes, loose electrical wires and debris that fill the street and sidewalks. ""White Cane Day is always one of my favorite days of the year,"" says Htun, who has been blind since he was a child. With the aid of his cane, he detects – and then steps over a pothole. ""It's probably one of the most important days of the year for our community"" – a time to catch up with old friends and be part of a day of advocacy. White Cane Day was first declared by the U.S. Congress on October 15, 1964. The goal was to raise awareness of the accomplishments of the blind and visually impaired and to emphasize the importance of the white cane. ""For many visually-impaired people the white cane is a symbol of independence and safety,"" says Penny Hartin, CEO of the World Blind Union. ""Using it enables people to do everyday tasks on their own and not have to rely on others. It really brings a special independence to peoples' lives."" The cane ""extends our sense of touch so we're able to detect obstacles and safely navigate our environments,"" explains Chris Danielsen, a spokesman for the National Federation of the Blind. ""You extend it in front of you and sweep it from side to side, anticipating your next step."" Over the years, White Cane Day has been embraced by countries around the world. In developing countries, its mission is critical because of a general lack of knowledge about white canes. ""When I travel on my own across the country people don't understand what my cane means,"" says Emma Parker, director of the Sierra Leone Association of the Blind in Freetown, the country's capital. ""And those who do realize I am blind will try to help by pulling the cane or pulling on my arms to try and guide me. They don't know what to do, and it makes getting around much harder."" Grabbing a person's white cane is ""kind of insulting to the blind person, leading them by a leash almost — and they're not able to use the cane,"" says Danielsen of the National Federation of the Blind. To give the general public an idea of what it is like to be blind, Parker says that workshops are held on White Cane Days. One year, sighted attendees were blindfolded and instructed to walk around with a white cane. 
                More than 1,000 people — those with visual impairment as well as theirs friends and supporters — took part in the 2017 White Cane Day walk in downtown Yangon.

 ""After a few minutes they would cry out, 'Oh! We now know that it's difficult for you when we try to pull and push you around!'"" says Parker, with a hearty laugh. ""People started to really understand our difficulties. And over the years more people have begun to understand the white cane."" White Cane Day also emphasizes the obstacles that face the visually impaired in every walk of life. ""We confront barriers in education, transportation, health, dealing with monetary issues like banks and currency, even our social life,"" says Asoka Weerawardhana, who serves as an officer on the Sri Lanka Council for the Blind. ""There are so many restrictions."" Of course there are obstacles in the developed world as well. ""I went to Athens a couple of months ago and was walking around the old city with my cane,"" says Hartin. ""All of a sudden the sidewalk would stop and there would be a building in front of me. Even the cities that are a bit more modern sometimes don't really have a clear, smooth footpath.""

Locals were mystified by the tourists spending several days photographing a single tree. ""Sometimes we have to explain to people what we're doing but often they just think, 'Okay these guys are nuts,'"" says New York photographer Len Jenshel. 
                A huge mango tree serves as the village center in Naunde, Mozambique. Under its branches, people tell stories, make marriage arrangements and resolve land disputes. On their visit, the photographers mainly found children playing.

He and fellow photographer Diane Cook spent three years making Wise Trees, a book of tree portraits. The first photographs were taken at a place once known as Ground Zero. There they documented the blossoming ""Survivor Tree,"" a Callery pear that had been pulled out of the ruins of the World Trade Center weeks after the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. Burned and broken, the tree was nursed back to health and re-planted a decade later at what is now the National September 11 Memorial. 
                At the Dukh Haran Hanuman Temple in Varanasi, India, people pray to the monkey god Hanuman, who is believed to be embodied in this pipal tree. Devotees leave offerings, rub vermilion paste into the tree's bark and wrap thread around the tree's base.

 Cook and Jenshel have worked together since 1991. A husband and wife team, they met years before ""through cannoli, not cameras."" For the book, she undertook the research while he sweet-talked their way into getting permission to photograph trees that were on private property. 
                A road runs straight through Bunut Bolong, a sacred banyan tree in West Bali. Engineers insisted the land the tree grew on was the best place for the road, so Hindu worshippers — who are forbidden from cutting down holy trees — prayed for forgiveness for the giant hole. ""Even though this is a busy roadway in steep terrain, people actively come and worship this tree,"" says Diane Cook.

""Even though this is a busy roadway in steep terrain, people actively come and worship this tree,"" says Diane Cook. And then came the challenge of making pictures. ""Technically every tree poses a new challenge on how to photograph it,"" says Jenshel. They had to consider lighting, season, angle and how close or far away to shoot to capture each tree's most significant traits. The idea was born on a night in 2012. The couple was photographing cherry blossoms after dusk in Japan. Cook got a call that her father in the United States was dying. They watched pale white petals from the trees float away in the wind. ""We looked at this amazing ritual of life and renewal, which happens every spring,"" says Cook. ""And somehow, when we came back from that trip, we started thinking about the wisdom that we get from trees.""

Authorities diverted a major highway to spare the tree and dug a deeper well because of disappearing swampland.

 The trees featured in their book offer shade and solace. Some give guidance, like a tree Native Americans once used as a reminder to leave one river and cross to a different waterway. Others are seen as a source of healing, like sacred trees in India. And a few have been silent witnesses to humanity's darkest times. Both Jenshel and Cook say the hardest tree to photograph was what became known as the Killing Tree in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. During Pol Pot's brutal reign, prison guards held babies and children by their feet and smashed their skulls against the tree. Sometimes mothers were forced to watch before they were killed, too. ""We kept it together while we were there in the field but it took us weeks to recover from photographing that tree,"" says Cook. The book — published by Abrams in October — features images taken in 11 countries as well as the United States.

npr,"October 14, 2017","To Save Her Children, She Pretended To Be Crazy"," Ingenuity, inspiration, an elaborate ruse and a touch of madness. That is what it took for Zainabu Hamayaji to protect her family from Boko Haram. The terror network in northeastern Nigeria has killed 20,000 people, abducted thousands more and driven more than 2 million people from their homes during its eight-year insurgency. The 47-year-old mother of 10 — four biological and six orphaned children ranging from age 5 to 15 — had to feign insanity to keep the insurgents away. Her priority, during a hellish period under Boko Haram occupation, was to hide her 11-year-old daughter, Hassana Isa, because she had heard fighters were in town looking for girls to marry. ""I was told Boko Haram was approaching and looking for young girls,"" she says. ""Someone had tipped them off that I had a daughter of marriageable age, but I swore to myself that I would never allow them to wed or abduct my daughter."" Quick thinking was the only way to outwit the insurgents, who overran the town of Madagali in Adamawa state in the troubled northeast, says Hamayaji. She was living there with her family in 2014 when Boko Haram extremists swung into town and took over. ""The fighters were killing people who tried to escape,"" says Hamayaji. ""They killed my husband and many other men,"" so she had no choice but to remain in Madagali. Boko Haram soon seized control of swaths of territory in the area. ""I saw them killing so many people,"" says Hamayaji, ""because they tried to get away."" Hamayaji went to extreme lengths to safeguard her young daughter Hassana. She dug a deep ditch at the back of her compound. And there her daughter remained for the next nine months. ""I put her inside with 100 jerrycans of water, sacks of food supplies and leather bags so that she could relieve herself, using the latter as a toilet. She cooked in that ditch and did everything there. And she had the Holy Quran so she could pray. Of course, she was frightened,"" says Hamayaji of her daughter, who is now nearly 15, ""but I told her she had to stay there."" She placed a corrugated iron sheet above the deep hole. But Boko Haram kept asking where her daughter was. ""I swore to those fighters that I had no daughter, but they wouldn't believe me and they kept beating me up — and looking for her."" Hamayaji shows us a scar on her forehead and a missing front tooth and says she still has a dislocated shoulder from the repeated beatings. ""They assaulted me and terrorized my family,"" she tells us. Boko Haram shot into the global headlines in April 2014 after they abducted 276 schoolgirls from their dorms in Chibok in the northeast. Thousands more girls, women and boys have also been abducted — before and since the Chibok girls. At the time, Boko Haram's leader bragged that the schoolgirls would be converted to Islam and forced to marry his fighters. Sexual abuse, rape and forced marriages were rampant, with young women who've regained their freedom sharing their stories of sex exploitation, rape and physical abuse. Some have chosen to remain with their ""husbands"" in the bush, refusing to leave Boko Haram captivity. A few have openly abandoned freedom and returned to live with the insurgents. Using girls as young as 10 and young women as suicide bombers is a hallmark of Boko Haram's campaign of violence. But it wasn't just Hamayaji's eldest daughter, Hassana, she had to protect. She also had to find a way to stop the insurgents who had occupied Madagali from harassing her family. That was when she hatched the plan to pretend she was mad, she says. As if on stage, Hamayaji shifts back into character and re-enacts the role, with a wild look in her eyes. It's how she behaved during the months she was jeered at and shunned for being the ""crazy woman."" ""I decided to strip off all my clothes and march around town naked, to look like a madwoman,"" she says. ""I unbraided my hair and smeared urine and feces in my hair and on my body. There were flies hovering everywhere around me. And I would roll around in trash heaps so that Boko Haram would think I was mentally unstable."" Hamayaji says the fighters returned again and again to her home, asking her children, ""Is your mother all right? She seemed fine when we came by here earlier."" Her kids played along and kept telling the insurgents she had been mentally unstable for a long while and frequently had to go to the psychiatric hospital before Boko Haram captured the town. Initially skeptical, the militants fell for her ploy, says Hamayaji. The terror group decided they didn't want the daughter of a madwoman. Hamayaji says that earlier they had killed one madwoman, and the fighters believed that act had cursed them, robbing them of military success. ""So they didn't want to kill another madwoman and considered it bad luck to kill someone who was crazy. That's how we were spared,"" she says. ""They scrawled on a wall that nobody should touch me or my children or they would be cursed. That's how we were protected."" ""I went to those lengths to protect my family and to save my daughter from being abducted and married off to a Boko Haram fighter,"" says Hamayaji. She had succeeded, but it took many difficult months until the family was eventually rescued by the military that drove Boko Haram out of Madagali. Then suspicion fell on her. The soldiers asked Hamayaji whether she married a Boko Haram commander. ""When the soldiers met me, they said 'Are you a Boko Haram wife?' I insisted I was not,"" she says. Then they asked her how she had managed to stay safe without collaborating with the insurgents while they controlled the town? She explained her ruse — behaving like a madwoman and hiding her daughter in a ditch for almost a year. It was only when she led them to the ditch that the military believed Hamayaji, she says. ""We went there together. When we opened up the hole, there she was, where I'd left her nine months earlier and then Hassana came out."" I ask whether she felt like a heroine for protecting her family. Hamayaji said no. She said she didn't know of other women who had taken such extreme steps to shield their children from Boko Haram. ""None at all."" I inquired insistently, ""No other women acted like you?"" In an unexpected, yet matter-of-fact reply, Hamayaji responded, ""There were not many women who sacrificed like that. Other women gave away their children for selfish reasons. Some gave away their daughters. Others were forced to hand out a daughter here and there, because they didn't have any food and they had to eat. They'd get provisions in exchange."" 
                Hamayaji, her children and many other displaced persons now live in Twenty Houses, a camp in Gwoza, northeast Nigeria.

 Hamayaji, her children and many other displaced persons now live in Twenty Houses, a camp in Gwoza, northeast Nigeria. Boko Haram was also handing out money at the time — the equivalent of about $350 to $700, she said. She added that sometimes the fighters would give mothers land in the areas they had seized as a payment or ""dowry"" for their daughters. ""The women would be so elated,"" she remembers. ""They'd collect both the money and the properties."" Hamayaji has left Madagali to return to her hometown, Gwoza, 15 miles away across the border in Borno state. Pain and other emotions play on her face as she shares her ordeal with NPR. Thrusting her arms forward as she speaks, her eyes dart around a disused classroom. It has a giant blackboard with a huge bullet hole bang in the middle. Peer through it and you witness life outside at Twenty Houses, a camp for displaced persons where Hamayaji, her children and many others now live in Gwoza. Chairs and desks are in a jumbled stack behind her. Most children are not in school. Gwoza was the headquarters of Boko Haram's short-lived caliphate until the extremists were swept out of the town by the Nigerian army in 2015. ""Liberated Gwoza is peaceful under the military and secure,"" says Hamayaji. ""What I want now is for my children, including Hassana, to go to school and get an education so they have a future."" But she has no money and has to beg to feed her family. She is appealing to relief workers to ""please help."" Despite the army's presence, potential insecurity lurks just a few miles away from the lush Mandara mountains of Gwoza. In the Sambisa Forest, Boko Haram's stronghold has held many people captive, with other abducted people still believed to be held in the group's hideout. We're all neighbors on our tiny globe.

She made breakfast for her 2-year-old daughter, left the child with her neighbor and started the long walk to the village of Ambohitsara. Bacquerette wanted to make sure she was one of the first people in line for a one-day-only family planning clinic. Credit: Alyson Hurt/NPR She walked almost two hours on footpaths that snake along the sandy bank of the Canal des Pangalanes in eastern Madagascar. And she managed to arrive at the event just after it started. The 33-year-old single mother had come to get an IUD. ""Life is hard,"" Bacquerette says, explaining why she wants an IUD. ""It's very hard to have very many children."" Bacquerette, who like many people in this part of Madagascar goes by just one name, would like to have more children ... but not right now. This clinic might be her last chance to get an IUD or any other long-lasting contraceptive for the foreseeable future, mainly because of the changing political landscape 9,000 miles away in Washington, D.C. One of the first acts of the Trump administration in January was to reinstate an abortion-related litmus test for foreign aid known as the ""Mexico City policy."" 
                Women gather in Ambohitsara, Madagascar, for a one-day contraception clinic. The international health group Marie Stopes runs mobile clinics in remote parts of the country where women have limited access to birth control.

 Under the policy, foreign aid groups are barred from getting U.S. funding if they perform or actively support abortion anywhere in the world. The Trump administration broadened the policy to apply not just to grants for family planning but to billions of dollars in global health assistance given to groups that offer everything from malaria prevention to HIV treatment. The newly expanded policy is being felt throughout the developing world. In Madagascar the change is forcing dramatic cutbacks by the largest provider of long-term contraception in the country, the British nonprofit Marie Stopes International. Nearly half of Marie Stopes funding in Madagascar, millions of dollars a year, had been coming from USAID. In Madagascar, Marie Stopes does not provide abortions because abortion is illegal in the country. But the parent organization in London refuses to renounce abortion as part of reproductive health services in some of its operations in other parts of the world. The loss of USAID funding has forced Marie Stopes to shut down a voucher program in Madagascar that allowed low-income women to get contraceptives for free at private clinics. And by the end of the year, it's planning to wind down 21 of its 22 mobile contraception clinics, which were funded entirely by USAID. As part of the group's services, local nurses travel to incredibly remote parts of Madagascar in four-wheel- drive Land Cruisers, trains, boats and even hovercraft to run family planning clinics. 
                Nurse Valeria Zafisoa helps her daughter board the boat that takes staff of Marie Stopes International to villages along the Pangalanes Canal to set up clinics. They'll often travel for hours on end to reach a stop.

 There's a saying in Ambohitsara that a married woman should bear at least 7 children for her husband. Some do, but many women now want fewer kids. And at the start of the contraception clinic event, that's abundantly clear. More than 100 women and girls are packed in to the sandy courtyard of the health clinic. They range in age from 14 to their early 40s. One of the nurses from Marie Stopes, Olivia Haingoniaina, is holding up a blue plastic replica of a penis and demonstrating how to use a condom. The crowd erupts in laughter when she jokes about how a condom is much easier to take off than put on.

 All of this has been funded by grants from the U.S. Agency for International Development. In one room of the clinic, Zafisoa screens the women. Then next door Haingoniaina inserts the implant or IUD. Among the visitors to the contraception clinic that day is Nirivelo, a chief from an adjacent village. He wants to make sure several teenage girls from his village get contraceptive implants. Nirivelo says in the past having a large family was viewed as a sign of wealth and prosperity here. And girls would often start having children in their mid-teens. He says families are now having fewer children, which means fewer mouths to feed. He adds that it's also easier to work the rice fields if you don't have a kid hanging off each hip. And delaying pregnancy also makes it more likely that girls will finish high school. 
                In eastern Madagascar people record their medical information in inexpensive notebooks adorned with European soccer stars. At the mobile clinic, the nurses write the women's vital signs in the ledgers and the replacement date for contraceptive implants.

 Nirivelo says that recently one girl from his village, a student at the secondary school in Ambohitsara, got pregnant. And it's been a big problem. Her parents are upset. They want the father of her child to marry her. But the boy's parents can't afford to pay a dowry, he says. It's caused a little war in the village. To make sure this kind of situation doesn't come up again, he's telling the other students to come to this contraception clinic. That attitude reflects Madagascar's goals for family planning. In 2015 the government set an ambitious goal of boosting its rate of contraception use from 30 percent to 50 percent. But that soon may no longer be possible. Lalaina Razafinasoa, the country director of Marie Stopes Madagascar, says her group has already shut down some of its family planning work in the country and plans to stop the mobile contraception clinics in a matter of months unless they can find other source of revenue. ""It's really unbelievable to have to have this happen,"" she says. Despite its reputation as an exotic Indian Ocean destination, Madagascar remains an incredibly poor country. More than 75 percent of the population lives in poverty.

 Razafinasoa says the loss of U.S. funding means that hundreds of thousands of women in this country of 25 million people will lose access to contraception. And they will also lose the care that the group provides for women who defy the law and have illegal abortions. ""We are providing post-abortion care,"" she says. ""We are providing post-abortion family planning."" Razafinasoa pauses. She shakes her head as if she still can't really believe these cuts are happening. ""It will be a disaster,"" she says.

npr,"October 12, 2017",India's Supreme Court Rules That Sex With A Bride Under 18 Is Rape," India has made a significant change to its laws about rape. The Supreme Court has ruled that if a husband has sex with his wife and she is under 18, he is committing an act of rape. Up until now rape was illegal, but there was one glaring exception. A wife could not bring charges of rape against her husband unless she was under age 15 — an age set in a 1940 law. But using the age of 15 seemingly posed a contradiction with several other laws in India meant to protect girls under 18. For one thing, marriage to a bride under age 18 was made illegal in 1978. Previously there had been younger age cutoffs for child marriage. Also, the Protection of Children from Sexual Offenses Act, enacted in 2012, states that minors do not have the right to consent to sex. So having a sex with a minor of any age would be a crime. But the reality in India didn't match the laws. Child marriage remains widespread to this day. And the contradiction between the age set in the 1940 law and subsequent laws was not addressed. That's what this new ruling does. On Wednesday, a two-member bench of the Supreme Court of India ruled that sex with any underage girl, even if she's a bride, would be considered an act of rape. So child brides age 15 to 18 now have the same legal protection that younger girls do. Of course, that still leaves women older than 18 who are raped by their husband without legal recourse. But advocates for girls and women are hailing the law as a step in the right direction. ""My sense is that this ruling might also in some way act as a deterrent against underage marriage,"" says Manish, a lawyer and researcher with the Centre for Policy Research in New Delhi who goes by only one name. Lawyers who work with underage rape survivors say that often courts will treat minors as if they're adults, ignoring birth certificates to hasten plea bargains and move matters through the backlogged system faster. Sometimes, courts even force underage victims to marry their assailants. Age does matter, says Rashi Vidyasagar, a criminologist in Bangalore. So while this ruling is a small step in her view, she believes it could have an impact. Implementation of the new ruling is going to be a challenge, says Vidyasagar. ""Will the ruling apply from the day of the verdict? If it's applied retroactively, how far back?"" Vidyasagar asks semi-facetiously, ""Do we automatically put their husbands in jail? How will we apply it? That's the question most of us are asking."" The new law does not address the issue of marital rape for wives over age 18. Vidyasagar and other advocates are hopeful that the courts will now tackle marital rape for women of all ages. Chhavi Sachdev is a journalist based in Mumbai. Contact her @chhavi.

npr,"October 23, 2017",Screening For Diabetes Is Working Better Than Thought," Undiagnosed diabetes may not be as big of a public health problem as thought. That's the takeaway from a study published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine that says that some previous efforts have likely overestimated the number of people with undiagnosed diabetes because they relied on a single positive test result. By contrast, this new measure used the American Diabetes Association's diagnostic criteria, which recommend that people with one positive fasting blood glucose or A1C test should have a second test to confirm a diagnosis in all but the most severe and obvious cases of Type 2 diabetes. That's because there's some inherent variability in the tests and because blood sugar levels fluctuate naturally because of exercise, illness and even the time of day. If left untreated, Type 2 diabetes can contribute to kidney disease, nerve damage, high blood pressure and stroke. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has applied the less stringent standard to data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and the U.S. Census to come up with an estimate of 33.3 million people with diabetes in 2015, 7.2 million of whom, or almost 24 percent, were undiagnosed. When researchers in this study applied the stricter clinical diagnostic standard to the same data, they came up with an estimate of 25.5 million people with diabetes, with about 2.8 million, or about 11 percent, of them undiagnosed. ""This is good news,"" says Elizabeth Selvin, a professor of epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and the lead author of the study. ""We're doing a good job with screening and diagnosis."" But she says that doesn't mean diabetes isn't a public health problem, and a significant one at that; the study found the prevalence of diabetes in the U.S. population has risen from 5.5 percent in 1988-1994 to 10.8 percent in 2011-2014. The proportion of undiagnosed cases has dropped from 16.3 percent over the same period, the study found. The difference in how the estimates are calculated is due to the difference between epidemiological studies, which track patterns and trends across an entire population, and clinical practice, which focuses on individual patients. If you're just studying historical trends, using a single-test value isn't such a big deal, says Selvin. ""But if we are focused on the burden of undiagnosed diabetes, or the percentage of diabetes that's undiagnosed, it becomes important,"" she says. (A CDC spokeswoman says the agency doesn't directly comment on studies that aren't its own.) The results suggest that public health efforts to promote screening should be focused more closely on the people who are most likely to have undiagnosed diabetes rather than the population as a whole. According to the study, that group includes people who are obese, a racial or ethnic minority, and who don't have health insurance or get regular health care. While increased age is also a risk factor, the authors noted that there's an undiagnosed group of overweight and obese younger adults with very high A1C levels who are likely not engaged with the health care system and are falling through the cracks. ""We're not missing hordes of people, which isn't to say we aren't missing some people,"" says Anne Peters, an endocrinologist and professor of medicine at the Keck School of Medicine at USC, who wrote an editorial accompanying the study. ""We need to continue to reach out to the people who do need help."" She says more and more programs are focused on preventing diabetes in the first place, focusing on people with risk factors such as obesity and high cholesterol. That can help people avoid the complications of full-blown diabetes, and the label of having a chronic disease, which have long-term psychological effects as well as consequences for buying life insurance and long-term care insurance, Peters says. (And health insurance, if current Affordable Care Act rules about pre-existing conditions should change.) The study's authors pointed out some limitations of their work. Among them: the data includes fasting glucose and A1C levels taken only at one point in time, and the results might differ if samples were taken later. And the diagnosis of diabetes depends on study participants' self-reports, which may not be accurate. Katherine Hobson is a freelance health and science writer based in Brooklyn, N.Y.

npr,"October 23, 2017","In Memory Training Smackdown, One Method Dominates"," When it comes to brain training, some workouts seem to work better than others. A comparison of the two most common training methods scientists use to improve memory and attention found that one was twice as effective as the other. The more effective method also changed brain activity in a part of the brain involved in high-level thinking. But neither method made anyone smarter, says Kara Blacker, the study's lead author and a researcher at The Henry M. Jackson Foundation for the Advancement of Military Medicine in Bethesda, Md. ""Our hypothesis was that training might improve fluid intelligence or IQ,"" Blacker says. ""But that's not what we found."" Blacker did the memory research when she was part of a team at Johns Hopkins University and the Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore. The results were reported in the Journal of Cognitive Enhancement. The team compared two approaches to improving working memory, which acts as a kind of mental workspace where we store information temporarily. ""If somebody gives you directions, you have to keep that information in mind long enough to actually execute going to that location,"" Blacker says. ""If someone tells you a phone number, you have to be able to remember it."" To test different methods for improving working memory, the team had 136 young adults spend a month training their brains for 30 minutes a day, five days a week. One group did something called a ""complex span"" test, which involves remembering the location of an item despite distractions. A second group trained with something called the dual n-back test. Each day they would sit at a computer watching flashing squares appear on a grid and listening to a voice reading letters from the alphabet. At first, participants were asked to recall the second-to-last square location and letter in each sequence. In n-back parlance, that's the ""1-back."" But then they had to recall which squares and letters they'd encountered ""3 back"" or ""4 back"" or even ""5 back"" in the sequence. ""It sounds very difficult,"" Blacker says. ""But people get surprisingly good at it."" And the n-back training was clearly more effective than complex span training. People who used it showed a 30 percent improvement in working memory, nearly twice as much as people who did complex span training. ""The really exciting part was that we found the dual n-back group showed significant changes in their brain activity,"" Blacker says. Electrodes measuring electrical activity showed an increase in ""alpha band"" brain waves in an area of the brain that plays a critical role in attention, memory and higher-level thinking. But all those brain changes didn't help the n-back group score higher on measures of overall intelligence, Blacker says. ""Brain training is still in its early stages,"" she says. ""We're still trying to figure out what these programs are doing."" In the meantime, she says, consumers shouldn't count on any of the commercially available brain training programs to make them smarter. Many commercial and academic brain training methods have focused on working memory because people with high intelligence tend to have very good working memory. But efforts to boost IQ by improving working memory haven't panned out, says Bradley Voytek, a brain scientist at the University of California, San Diego, who was not involved in the study. ""We want to just be able to pull up our iPhone while we're sitting on the train or at a bus stop or something, play a game for a couple minutes, and get smarter,"" he says. But we can't. That's because existing brain training programs seem to improve only a very narrow set of skills rather than overall intelligence. And that's not very surprising if you accept that training the brain is a lot like training the body, Voytek says. You wouldn't expect people who practice cycling every day to become great sprinters, he says. ""They're not going to be able to compete against Usain Bolt, just like if you put Usain Bolt on a bike [he's] not going to be able to compete with a world-class cyclist.""

npr,"October 22, 2017",Learning To Care For My Newborn Was A Humbling Experience," The night we arrived home, Eli wouldn't stop crying. Crying is normal in newborns, my husband and I assured each other. We held him and rocked him. Over the next 48 hours, we took shifts, staying up with Eli to try to soothe him through the near-nonstop crying. We called our friends for advice on how to deal with what we now labeled a ""difficult baby."" Things went downhill quickly. Our pediatrician confirmed that he was noticeably jaundiced. In just three days, he had lost 15 percent of his body weight. Though I was feeding him every two hours, it turned out that Eli never had a good latch on my breasts, and I wasn't producing enough milk. We were told that he might need to be readmitted to the hospital. I was overcome with shame and guilt. What kind of mother am I who was barely keeping my own baby alive? What is wrong with my body that something so natural didn't happen? How could I, as a physician, not recognize that my baby was actually starving — and instead, blame him for expressing hunger in the only way he was able to? As Eli began to catch up on feeds, I tried to gain perspective. Becoming a mother brings many new challenges. No matter how much I may know about the scientific benefits of breast-feeding, I needed help. My hospital has a wonderful lactation consultant and I have a terrific pediatrician; together, they helped us to get back on track. As I learned, I was hardly alone; 92 percent of women have trouble with breast-feeding initially. This was one of many humbling realizations that caring for a newborn requires many skills that I had yet to learn. My experience has made me even more dedicated to public health programs to support women and ensure a healthy start for their babies. I'm health commissioner for the city of Baltimore, and responsible for overseeing programs like the B'More for Healthy Babies (BHB) initiative, which provides home visits by nurses, social workers and community health aides. They teach parents the ABCs of safe sleep (Alone, on the Back, in a Crib) and help with breast-feeding, resources to quit smoking, and other services like assistance with housing. Since BHB started in 2009, the city has cut infant mortality by nearly 40 percent and reduced the disparity between African-American and white mortality by half. BHB's engagement with every Baltimore hospital and dozens of community groups and churches has resulted in a 70 percent reduction in sleep-related infant deaths in just seven years. The program also works to improve on women's health before and during pregnancy. Studies show that women who do not receive prenatal care are five times more likely to have babies who die than women who do. I was fortunate that I received excellent care from a terrific obstetrician at Mercy Hospital. I was also fortunate that I have good health insurance. When complications occurred that necessitated additional ultrasounds and blood tests, I didn't hesitate to do what was best for my baby. Not all women are that lucky. We must do everything we can to safeguard programs like Medicaid so that women who face economic and social challenges have the opportunity to raise healthy children. Furthermore, the United States remains only one of two countries in the world that does not have paid parental leave. Despite ample research showing health benefits for maternity leave, including fewer illnesses in babies and reduced maternal depression, up to 1 in 4 women are back to work within two weeks of giving birth. I had an uncomplicated delivery and am otherwise healthy, but I cannot fathom being back at work when my baby required near-constant attention and my body was still healing. Going back to work after eight weeks has been a challenge, and that's with a caring partner, reliable child care and a supportive workplace. If the health of families and future of children are core values in our society, then we should implement policies that foster these values. We need health care for all regardless of ability to pay; paid parental and sick leave; and affordable child care. We must recognize that caring for newborns is hard, and that women and families need support and services to give every child the chance to grow and to thrive. We must uphold our duty to care for the most vulnerable and level the playing field of inequality. This week, hundreds of families will gather at the National Aquarium to celebrate BHB's anniversary. As I prepare remarks to share there with the families that I serve, I also celebrate Eli's two-month ""birthday"" with a visit to the pediatrician. I am thrilled that he has more than made up for the initial weight loss and is now a happy and chubby 11-pounder. He also received his immunizations at this visit, which gives me the perfect opportunity to add an important public health message: vaccines are safe, effective, and life-saving! There is much that I have yet to learn about motherhood and caring for my baby, but I feel so blessed every day to have him and to embark on the next chapter of our journey together.

npr,"October 21, 2017",Many Breast Cancer Patients Receive More Radiation Therapy Than Needed," When Annie Dennison was diagnosed with breast cancer last year, she readily followed advice from her medical team, agreeing to harsh treatments in the hope of curing her disease. ""You're terrified out of your mind"" after a diagnosis of cancer, said Dennison, 55, a retired psychologist from Orange County, Calif. In addition to lumpectomy surgery, chemotherapy and other medications, Dennison underwent six weeks of daily radiation treatments. She agreed to the lengthy radiation regimen, she said, because she had no idea there was another option. Medical research published in The New England Journal of Medicine in 2010 – six years before her diagnosis — showed that a condensed, three-week radiation course works just as well as the longer regimen. A year later, the American Society for Radiation Oncology, which writes medical guidelines, endorsed the shorter course. In 2013, the society went further and specifically told doctors not to begin radiation on women like Dennison – who was over 50, with a small cancer that hadn't spread – without considering the shorter therapy. ""It's disturbing to think that I might have been overtreated,"" Dennison said. ""I would like to make sure that other women and men know this is an option."" Dennison's oncologist, Dr. David Khan of El Segundo, Calif., notes that there are good reasons to prescribe a longer course of radiation for some women. Khan, an assistant clinical professor at UCLA, said he was worried that the shorter course of radiation would increase the risk of side effects, given that Dennison had undergone chemotherapy as part of her breast cancer treatment. The latest radiation guidelines, issued in 2011, don't include patients who've had chemo. Yet many patients still aren't told about their choices. An exclusive analysis for Kaiser Health News found that only 48 percent of eligible breast cancer patients today get the shorter regimen, in spite of the additional costs and inconvenience of the longer type. The analysis was completed by eviCore healthcare, a South Carolina-based medical benefit management company, which analyzed records of 4,225 breast cancer patients treated in the first half of 2017. The women were covered by several commercial insurers. All were over age 50 with early-stage disease. The data ""reflect how hard it is to change practice,"" said Dr. Justin Bekelman, associate professor of radiation oncology at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine. A growing number of patients and doctors are concerned about overtreatment, which is rampant across the health care system, argues Dr. Martin Makary, a professor of surgery and health policy at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore. From duplicate blood tests to unnecessary knee replacements, millions of patients are being bombarded with screenings, scans and treatments that offer little or no benefit, Makary said. Doctors estimated that 21 percent of medical care is unnecessary, according to a survey Makary published in September in the journal PLOS One. Unnecessary medical services cost the health care system at least $210 billion a year, according to a 2009 report by the National Academy of Medicine, a prestigious science advisory group. Those procedures aren't only expensive. Some clearly harm patients. Overzealous screening for cancers of the thyroid, prostate, breast and skin, for example, leads many older people to undergo treatments unlikely to extend their lives, but which can cause needless pain and suffering, said Dr. Lisa Schwartz, a professor at the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice. ""It's just bad care,"" said Dr. Rebecca Smith-Bindman, a professor at the University of California-San Francisco, whose research has highlighted the risk of radiation from unnecessary CT scans and other imaging. Outdated Treatments All eligible breast cancer patients should be offered a shorter course of radiation, said Dr. Benjamin Smith, an associate professor of radiation oncology at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Studies show that side effects from the shorter regimen are the same or even milder than traditional therapy, Smith said. ""Any center that offers antiquated, longer courses of radiation can offer these shorter courses,"" said Smith, lead author of the radiation oncology society's 2011 guidelines. Smith, who is currently updating the expert guidelines, recently said there's no evidence that women who've had chemo have more side effects if they undergo the condensed radiation course. ""There is no evidence in the literature to suggest that patients who receive chemotherapy will have a better outcome if they receive six weeks of radiation,"" Smith said. Shorter courses save money, too. Bekelman's 2014 study in JAMA, the journal of the American Medical Association, found that women given the longer regimen faced nearly $2,900 more in medical costs in the year after diagnosis. The high rate of overtreatment in breast cancer is ""shocking and appalling and unacceptable,"" said Karuna Jaggar, executive director of Breast Cancer Action, a San Francisco-based advocacy group. ""It's an example of how our profit-driven health system puts financial interests above women's health and well-being."" Just getting to the hospital for treatment imposes a burden on many women, especially those in rural areas, Jaggar said. Rural breast cancer patients are more likely than urban women to choose a mastectomy, which removes the entire breast but typically doesn't require follow-up radiation. Too Many Tests Meg Reeves, 60, believes much of her treatment for early breast cancer in 2009 was unnecessary. Looking back, she feels like she was treated ""with a sledgehammer.""

 At the time, Reeves lived in a small town in Wisconsin and had to travel 30 miles each way for radiation therapy. After she completed her course of treatment, doctors monitored her for eight years with a battery of annual blood tests and MRIs. The blood tests include screenings for tumor markers, which aim to detect relapses before they cause symptoms. Yet cancer specialists have repeatedly rejected these kinds of expensive blood tests and advanced imaging since 1997. For survivors of early breast cancer like Reeves – who had no signs of symptoms of relapse — ""these tests aren't helpful and can be hurtful,"" said Dr. Gary Lyman, a breast cancer oncologist and health economist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. Reeves' primary doctor declined to comment. In 2012, the American Society for Clinical Oncology, the leading medical group for cancer specialists, explicitly told doctors not to order the tumor marker tests and advanced imaging — such as CT, PET and bone scans — for survivors of early-stage breast cancer. Yet these tests remain common. Thirty-seven percent of breast cancer survivors underwent screening for tumor markers between 2007 and 2015, according to a study presented in June at the American Society of Clinical Oncology's annual meeting and published in the society's journal online. Sixteen percent of these survivors underwent advanced imaging. None of these women had symptoms of a recurrence, such as a breast lump, Lyman said. Beyond wasted time and worry for women, these scans also expose them to unnecessary radiation, a known carcinogen, Lyman said. A National Cancer Institute study estimated that 2 percent of all cancers in the United States could be caused by medical imaging. Paying The Price  Health care costs for breast cancer patients monitored with advanced imaging averaged nearly $30,000 in the year after treatment ended. That was about $11,600 more than for women who didn't get such follow-up tests, according to Lyman's study. Women monitored with biomarkers had nearly $6,000 in additional health costs. Reeves knows the costs of cancer treatment all too well. Although she had health insurance from her employer, she says she had to sell her house to pay her medical bills. ""It was financially devastating,"" Reeves said. ""It's the worst kind of financial toxicity, because you're incurring costs for something with no benefit,"" said Dr. Scott Ramsey, director of the Hutchinson Institute for Cancer Outcomes Research. Even simple blood tests take a toll, Reeves said. Repeated needle sticks – including those from unnecessary annual blood tests — have scarred the veins in her left arm, the only one from which nurses can draw blood, she says. Nurses avoid drawing blood on her right side – the side of her breast surgery – because it could injure that arm, increasing the risk of a complication called lymphedema, which causes painful arm swelling. Reeves also worries about the side effects of so many scans. After treatment ended, her doctor also screened her with yearly MRI scans using a dye called gadolinium. The Food and Drug Administration is investigating the safety of the dye, which leaves metal deposits in organs such as the brain. After suffering so much during cancer treatment, she doesn't want any more bad news about her health. Becoming An Advocate Kathi Kolb, 63, was staring at 35 radiation treatments over seven weeks in 2008 for her early breast cancer. But she was determined to educate herself and find another option. ""I had bills to pay, no trust fund, no partner with a big salary,"" said Kolb, a physical therapist from South Kingstown, R.I. ""I needed to get back to work as soon as I could."" 
                Kathi Kolb, a Rhode Island physical therapist, says she's frustrated that fewer than half of eligible breast cancer patients receive a shorter course of radiation, even though studies proved it was safe nearly 10 years ago.

 Kathi Kolb, a Rhode Island physical therapist, says she's frustrated that fewer than half of eligible breast cancer patients receive a shorter course of radiation, even though studies proved it was safe nearly 10 years ago. Kolb asked her doctor about a 2008 Canadian study showing that three weeks of radiation was safe. He agreed to try it. Even the short course left her with painful skin burns, blisters, swelling, respiratory infections and fatigue. She fears these symptoms would have been twice as bad if she had been subjected to the full seven weeks. ""I saved myself another month of torture and being out of work,"" Kolb said. ""By the time I started to feel the effects of being zapped [day] after day, I was almost done."" A growing number of medical and consumers groups are working to educate patients, so they can become their own advocates. The Choosing Wisely campaign, launched in 2012 by the American Board of Internal Medicine Foundation, aims to raise awareness about overtreatment. The effort, which has been joined by 80 medical societies, has listed 500 practices to avoid. It advises doctors not to provide more radiation for cancer than necessary, and to avoid screening for tumor markers after early breast cancer. ""Patients used to feel like 'more is better,' "" said Daniel Wolfson, executive vice president of the ABIM Foundation. ""But sometimes less is more. Changing that mindset is a major victory."" Yet Wolfson acknowledges that simply highlighting the problem isn't enough. Many doctors cling to outdated practices out of habit, said Dr. Bruce Landon, a professor of health care policy at Harvard Medical School. ""We tend in the health care system to be pretty slow in abandoning technology,"" Landon said. ""People say, 'I've always treated it this way throughout my career. Why should I stop now?' "" Many doctors say they feel pressured to order unnecessary tests out of fear of being sued for doing too little. Others say patients demand the services. In surveys, some doctors blame overtreatment on financial incentives that reward physicians and hospitals for doing more. Because insurers pay doctors for each radiation session, for example, those who prescribe longer treatments earn more money, said Dr. Peter Bach, director of Memorial Sloan Kettering's Center for Health Policy and Outcomes in New York. ""Reimbursement drives everything,"" said economist Jean Mitchell, a professor at Georgetown University's McCourt School of Public Policy. ""It drives the whole health care system."" Smith-Bindman, the UC-San Francisco professor, said the causes of overtreatment aren't so simple. The use of expensive imaging tests also has increased in managed care organizations in which doctors don't profit from ordering tests, her research shows. ""I don't think it's money,"" Smith-Bindman said. ""I think we have a really poor system in place to make sure people get care that they're supposed to be getting. The system is broken in a whole lot of places."" Dennison said she hopes to educate friends and others in the breast cancer community about new treatment options and encourage them to speak up. She said, ""Patients need to be able to say, 'I'd like to do it this way because it's my body.' "" KHN's coverage related to aging &amp; improving care of older adults is supported by The John A.

npr,"October 20, 2017",Rural Hospice That Spurns Federal Funds Has Offered Free Care for 40 Years," Helping her father die at home ""was the most meaningful experience in my nursing career,"" said Rose Crumb. She went on to found Volunteer Hospice of Clallam County in Port Angeles, Wash. Rose Crumb can't even count the number of people she's helped die. The former nurse, 91, who retired in her mid-80s, considers the question and then shakes her head, her blue eyes sharp above oval spectacles. ""Oh, hundreds,"" estimates Crumb, the woman who almost single-handedly brought hospice care to the remote Pacific Northwest city of Port Angeles, Wash., nearly 40 years ago. But the actual number of deaths she has witnessed is likely far higher — and Crumb's impact far greater — than even she will admit, say those affiliated with the Volunteer Hospice of Clallam County. ""[Rose] let people know hospice is not all about dying,"" said Bette Wood, who manages patient care for VHOCC. ""Hospice is about how to live each and every day."" In a nation where Medicare pays nearly $16 billion a year for hospice care, and nearly two-thirds of providers are for-profit businesses, the tiny volunteer hospice is an outlier. Since 1978, the hospice founded by Crumb — a mother of 10 and devoted Catholic — has offered free end-of-life care to residents of Port Angeles and the surrounding area. She was the first in the region to care for dying AIDS patients in the early days of the epidemic. Her husband, ""Red"" Crumb, who died in 1984 of leukemia, was an early patient. ""He died the most perfect death,"" Rose Crumb told visitors on a recent afternoon. ""He spent time alone with each of our kids. That meant so much to him."" At the same time, Crumb and her successors have refused to accept federal funding or private insurance, relying instead on a mostly volunteer staff and community donations to keep the hospice going. That's rare, said Jon Radulovic, a spokesman for the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization, NHPCO, a trade group. Most of the nation's 4,000-plus hospices receive Medicare payments for their services. He estimates there are only a few volunteer hospices like Crumb's in the U.S. There was pressure in the early years to ""take the money,"" as Crumb put it. But she had little use for the regulations that accompanied federal Medicare reimbursement starting in 1982. ""It was our experience that we could operate on a much smaller budget and we could be more flexible in providing services,"" Crumb wrote in a 2007 newsletter. Today, the hospice relies on 10 paid staff, 160 volunteers and an annual budget of less than $400,000 to provide end-of-life care for 300 patients each year, according to federal records. Patients don't have to meet Medicare's criteria of having six months or less to live to be enrolled, though most do. They can keep their own doctors instead of turning over care to a hospice physician. If families need medical equipment, the hospice supplies it for free.

 Eve Farrell holds a portrait of her husband, Daniel, in her Port Angeles, Wash., home. He died in January of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. ""I don't know how I would have made it without them,"" said Eve Farrell, 82, whose husband, Daniel, had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD. He died in January at age 80 after four months of hospice care at the couple's Port Angeles home. Staffers helped her husband shower when she couldn't lift him, offered advice about medication and gave her breaks from relentless caregiving. ""We felt like Dan was the only patient they had,"" Eve Farrell said. Crumb was drawn to hospice care in the 1970s, after the book ""On Death and Dying"" by Dr. Elisabeth Kübler-Ross galvanized conversations in the U.S. about how to treat the terminally ill. Years earlier, when Crumb's father was diagnosed with lymphoma, she helped him die at home. ""It was the most meaningful experience in my nursing career,"" she said. In April 1977, when Crumb attended a convention that included a program on hospice, she was hooked. ""Everything clicked,"" she recalled. ""I thought 'Yes!' "" Organizers had little money and less support, Crumb said. The local medical community was skeptical about hospice, which started in the U.S. in Connecticut in 1974. ""Some of the doctors called us 'the death squad,'"" Crumb said. Crumb's refusal to take federal funds put her at odds with the for-profit hospice industry, which lobbied state lawmakers in 1992 to eliminate an exemption that allowed volunteer hospices to remain unlicensed. Crumb had to enlist the services of her eighth child, Patrick Crumb, then a corporate lawyer, to fight back. ""In my view, they were clearly misrepresenting the current status of the law,"" recalled Patrick Crumb, 55, who is now president of the AT&amp;T; Sports Network. ""I told them, 'If you do what you're threatening to do, I'm going to sue you and I'm going to win.' "" Lawmakers eventually agreed to create an exemption to state law that allows volunteer hospices to remain unlicensed and unregulated. Crumb's hospice remains the only agency in state history to use it. In 2002, the volunteer hospice faced a for-profit rival, Assured Home Health and Hospice, now owned by the LHC Group based in Lafayette, La. Documents show that Assured officials predicted they'd serve 70 percent of the local hospice market within two years.

 But competition was fierce, recalled Dr. Tom Kummet, medical director at the Olympic Medical Cancer Center, who referred dying patients to hospice care. ""It was a bit of an awkward time,"" he said. ""Assured hospice wanted to be a successful business. And Volunteer Hospice was going to negatively impact their chances of being a successful business."" Fifteen years later, Assured still struggles, said Leslie Emerick, director of public policy and outreach for the Washington State Hospice and Palliative Care Organization. ""They tread lightly up there because of Rose,"" Emerick said. ""Rose is a beloved person in that community."" Officials with LHC declined to discuss competition in the Port Angeles market or to say how many patients Assured has enrolled. ""We value the care that Volunteer Hospice provides for our community,"" Candace Hammer Chaney, a local Assured manager and community liaison, said in a statement. Emerick and other hospice industry officials said volunteer hospices don't offer the range of services required of those who receive federal funding. And, Emerick added, there's little oversight. ""They don't have a reputation of negligence or complaints as far as I'm aware, but there's always the possibility of that when they're unlicensed or unregulated,"" she said. But Astrid Raffinpeyloz, VHOCC's volunteer services manager, said the hospice wouldn't have lasted long in a small town if there were problems. ""We don't have oversight from the government, but we have minute oversight from the community,"" said Raffinpeyloz.

 For Mike Clapshaw, 71, there was no question about who would care for his wife, Deborah, when her cancer came back for the third time, leading to her death in December 2014. She was 60. For the last four months of her life, VHOCC staff eased her pain — and his. ""It was always, 'What can I do to help?' "" he said. Helping was always the point, said Rose Crumb, whether the pain at the end of life was physical, emotional — or both. ""Some people just need someone to listen to them,"" she said. Crumb at nearly 92, now suffers from osteoporosis, congestive heart failure and other ailments that plagued her patients in earlier years. But she's not worried about her final days.

npr,"October 19, 2017",Pickleball For All: The Cross-Generational Power Of Play," It's a bright fall morning in Santa Cruz County, Calif., and the tennis area at Brommer Street Park is overrun with dozens of people. But they aren't here for tennis. Instead, cadences of pick-pock sounds fill the air as doubles players — many in their 50s and older — whack yellow Wiffle-like balls back and forth on eight minicourts. This recreational craze, which has an estimated 2.8 million players nationally, has a quirky name: pickleball. I stumbled across the game last summer, when I started coming to this park to hit the tennis balls around with my dad, who's still nimble at 87. Could this upstart racket sport, I wondered, be something my elderly father and I could enjoy together? My dad has played tennis for fun, for most of his life, but he's out of practice and slowing down. And with my bum knee and elbow tendinitis, I haven't played much tennis since high school. He's still better at the game, though I'm quicker on my feet; we both spend a lot of time trudging around to retrieve wayward balls. Pickleball, which borrows from tennis, ping pong and badminton, looks more manageable, and fun. Easy to learn, and feels gentler to joints than tennis The ball is lighter than a tennis ball, the paddle shorter and there isn't as much running back and forth. But the moderate exercise and social nature of the game keeps participants coming back. New research suggests that taking up pickleball as a serious form of leisure can enhance mental health and well-being in older adults. Pickleball was born as a cross-generational game in 1965 when three dads in Washington State invented it to entertain their kids. It's easy to learn, and — this is key — with less ground to cover on a smaller court, ""it's not that hard on the joints,"" says Drew Wathey, director of recreational programs at the USA Pickleball Association. It can be a great alternative to tennis as we get older, or for anyone nursing overuse injuries from other sports. The beauty of the game is that it can be enjoyed at any level of intensity, says Karen Long, a 57-year-old nurse who is president of the Santa Cruz Pickleball Club and a USA Pickleball ""ambassador."" Even sedentary seniors can safely be taught an easy doubles game, she says, starting with dinking the ball back and forth at the net. And though anyone can play it, Long says, ""it takes a long time to perfect."" Strategy and finesse are more important than driving the ball hard. Much of the game is played in quick-paced rallies up at the net, where an artfully dropped ""dink shot"" can win the point. That's why the sport lends itself well to intergenerational recreational play; older players can hold their own against young ones. Can be a good cardio workout for people with overuse injuries And it can be a good cardio workout, says Molly Smith, a 65-year-old exercise science professor at Weber State University, near Salt Lake City, Utah, who both plays and studies the game. Even if you've had shoulder or knee injuries, she says, ""you could still probably play a pretty competitive game of pickleball doubles and get your heart rate to the high end of the moderate-intensity exercise zone."" That's according to a preliminary study that Smith and colleagues conducted in a dozen middle-aged, novice and intermediate pickleball participants: Across 30 minutes of doubles play, their heart rates increased to an average of 117 beats per minute, with a peak rate of 140 — comparable to, say, fast ballroom dancing. And they burned 40 percent more calories than during a half-hour of walking. Injury risks from pickleball have yet to be systematically investigated, she says, when I ask about potential impacts on achy and aging joints. Even on a pickleball court, quick changes in direction while chasing the ball could put stress on the knees, notes Matt Denning, a sports biomechanics specialist at Brigham Young University's Idaho campus. For those with prior knee problems, he says, certain types of knee braces may help. Long, the nurse and pickleball aficionado in Santa Cruz, tells me pickleball has been gentler than tennis on her elbow, which she seriously injured five years ago as a competitive doubles player. She now competes in national pickleball tournaments instead. Beyond physical fitness benefits, 'camaraderie' improves life's quality But the exercise may not be the best part of the game. ""It's very social,"" says Dave Witte, treasurer for the Santa Cruz Pickleball Club, which welcomes beginners. The game seems to me more casual than tennis; because anybody can pick it up pretty quickly, that maybe increases the friendliness factor. ""You get that whole camaraderie thing going,"" Witte says. That's especially important for retirees, he says, because ""as you grow older, the last thing you want to do is become isolated."" Researchers have noticed the camaraderie, too, and have started examining the psychosocial benefits of the sport. In a study published this month in the Journal of Positive Psychology, investigators from Texas A&amp;M; University and Florida State University surveyed 153 participants, ages 51 to 85, at pickleball competitions. The more deeply engaged in pickleball these enthusiasts were, the more likely they were to be highly satisfied with their lives and have a positive experience with aging. Meanwhile, back at the park in Santa Cruz, spirits are high among the 50 people gathered to play pickleball on a weekday morning, some chitchatting in lawn chairs as they wait their turn. My dad sizes up the scene and opts to just observe the game, for now. Long hands me a loaner paddle, and she and a friend graciously instruct me in the basics. I'm matched up with two other beginners — Caroline Nicola, a 48-year-old massage therapist, and her mother, Heide Nicola. It's Heide's 75th birthday, and pickleball looked like ""a fun new activity to try out together,"" Caroline says. At first, I'm whiffing like a cartoon character on many shots. Ouch. My coordination is off because the plastic ball isn't as bouncy as I expected, and the racket is shorter than I'm used to. But the learning curve seems pretty quick. Dad, watching from nearby, is amused. Fast forward one week: We're back at the park, and my father says he's ready to give pickleball a try, too. As two regulars kindly coach us in doubles, I watch Dad grapple with the same frustration of missing his shots. ""Keep your eye on the ball,"" one instructor tells us. After an hour of practice we're both getting better. Dad still isn't ready to trade-in his tennis racket, but I'm hoping that with a few more pickleball sessions, he'll change his mind. I, meanwhile, can see how the game could become an addiction, if my joints hold up. So far, so good! We'll be out there again.

npr,"October 18, 2017",Diabetes Technology Moves Closer To Making Life Easier For Patients," For people with diabetes, keeping blood sugar levels in a normal range – not too high or too low – is a lifelong challenge. New technologies to ease the burden are emerging rapidly, but insurance reimbursement challenges, supply shortages, and shifting competition make it tough for patients to access them quickly. One new product is a fast-acting insulin from Novo Nordisk. It is designed to help to minimize the high blood sugar spikes that often occur when people with diabetes eat a meal containing carbohydrates. This new formulation, branded ""Fiasp,"" adds niacinamide (vitamin B3), which roughly doubles the speed of initial insulin absorption compared to current fast-acting insulins taken at mealtime. This new insulin hits the bloodstream in under three minutes. Another advance is Abbott's new monitoring device called the FreeStyle Libre Flash. It's new in the U.S. but has been available in Europe since 2014. It's a round patch with a catheter that is inserted on the arm for up to 10 days and a durable scanning device that the user waves over the patch to read the level of sugar in their tissues, which reflects the blood sugar level. 
                The FreeStyle Libre Flash lets users monitor glucose levels without having to frequently prick their fingers for blood testing.

 The Libre works a bit differently than the two currently available continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) made by Dexcom and Medtronic. The Libre doesn't require users to prick their fingers for blood tests to calibrate it, whereas users of the other monitors must perform twice-daily fingerstick calibrations. Also, the Libre is approved for longer wear – 10 days (14 in Europe) versus seven days for the two current CGMs. And, it is likely to be considerably less expensive, although Abbott isn't providing cost information for the U.S. just yet. In Europe, the Libre system costs about four Euros a day (about $4.70). But, unlike the current devices, the Libre doesn't issue alarms to users when their blood glucose levels get too high or too low. And the U.S. version also doesn't allow for the ""share"" capability, by which loved ones can follow Dexcom glucose monitor users' blood sugar levels remotely via a smartphone app. The Libre has been extremely popular in Europe among people with type 1 diabetes. There, fewer people use traditional CGMs compared to the U.S., in large part because they are not frequently covered by European insurance. Type 1 diabetes requires regular insulin doses to allow cells to use glucose, because the pancreas does not make any of its own. With type 2 diabetes, the insulin being made doesn't adequately meet the body's needs. About a quarter of people with type 2 diabetes take insulin, and of those, a smaller number take fast-acting insulin before meals. Those doses can lead to low or high blood glucose levels if not matched perfectly by timing and amount to the meal's carbohydrates. There's lots of room for user error. University of California, Los Angeles endocrinologist Dr. David T. Ahn, who specializes in diabetes technology, believes that in the U.S., the Libre will be more useful for people with type 2 diabetes. Most people with type 2 do not use CGMs and may also not perform frequent fingerstick checks. ""I think it's something that really empowers people, and that's what's really exciting, Ahn says. ""[Y]ou literally see firsthand what exercise, diet, rest, and stress do to your blood sugars."" Of course, he adds, ""There's benefit really for everybody, but the most important question is where is the cost justified. I would say that at least right now, it probably is only worth the cost for someone on insulin, especially on fast-acting insulin."" Jared Watkin president of Abbott Diabetes Care Division, tells Shots that the Libre was designed for people with either type of diabetes who require frequent glucose testing, and the lack of alarms was intentional. Research shows ""alarm fatigue"" is one of two main reasons many patients mention for not wanting to use CGM systems, he says. The other reason is cost. He points out that research on the Libre has also shown that people using the device achieve better glucose control and experience fewer low blood sugar episodes overnight compared to fingersticks alone even without the alarms, presumably because they're making more insulin dose adjustments. Aaron Kowalski is the chief mission officer for JDRF, formerly the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, which funds much of the research into diabetes technologies. He says it will be interesting to see how U.S. patients with type 1 diabetes who haven't adopted CGM take to the Libre. ""If you're coming at it from fingersticking, it makes massive sense ... For some people with type 1, I think it will be a really good option."" Closing the Loop: Progress And Pitfalls Both continuous glucose sensing and fast-acting insulin are critical components to the development of so-called ""closed-loop"" or artificial pancreas systems, which aim to automate insulin delivery to the point that patients themselves don't need to make complicated and error-prone calculations about how many carbs are in their meals or how much to cut back their insulin doses for exercise. In September 2016, The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Medtronic's 670G, the first device that partially accomplishes the closed-loop goal via an algorithm that allows the system's CGM to instruct its insulin pump to cut off delivery if the user's blood sugar drops, or increase it if the levels go too high. Several other companies are working on similar technology. One of those, a start-up called Bigfoot Biomedical is working with Abbott to use a next-generation version of the Libre's sensor. Except for Medtronic, the other major closed-loop competitors – Insulet, Tandem, and Beta-Bionics – are all collaborating with Dexcom. At the same time, a group of do-it-yourself hackers has figured out how to create their own closed-loop systems using older equipment and instructions that are freely available. Since that endeavor isn't regulated by the FDA, people who have done it – believed to number in the thousands at this point – proceed at their own risk. No major problems have been reported. Bumps in the Road, But Optimism Overall As might be expected, not everything in this field has gone smoothly. Due to both high demand and the fact that one of Medtronic's manufacturing plants located in Puerto Rico was damaged by Hurricane Maria, it has been unable to ship part of the 670G to new users, and may not be able to meet demand until 2018. In addition, the insurance company Anthem has said it won't cover the 670G because it has concluded ""there is not yet enough data on the longer-term safety and efficacy"" for the system. Meanwhile, although Medicare agreed in January 2017 to cover the Dexcom continuous glucose monitor for beneficiaries who use insulin, the agency recently determined that the device would not be covered if beneficiaries use the accompanying smartphone app that reads the glucose levels via bluetooth, because it doesn't meet the definition for ""durable medical equipment."" The decision means that seniors have to carry around a separate receiver device, and don't have access to the share function. Dexcom is negotiating with federal regulators to work out a solution. In a recent blog post, Ahn wrote ""While CGM approval by Dexcom is a huge win overall (it really is), restricting smartphone integration is absolutely ridiculous."" In another blow to the diabetes technology world, major pump manufacturer Animus recently announced that it was pulling out of the market and is shifting its approximately 90,000 current customers to Medtronic. Not surprisingly, some of Medtronic's competitors are offering deals to lure them to their own products. Despite the roadblocks, Kowalski says, ""I have tremendous optimism about the future for people with type 1 diabetes. These tools are really starting to ... improving blood sugar and making life easier. And that's a great thing. The more options the better."" Miriam E.

npr,"October 18, 2017","Drug Companies Make Eyedrops Too Big, And You Pay For The Waste"," Gregory Matthews has glaucoma and uses prescription eyedrops. The dropper's opening creates a bigger drop than he needs, causing him to run out of his medication before the prescription is ready to refill. If you've ever put in eyedrops, some of them have almost certainly spilled onto your eyelid or cheek. The good news is the mess doesn't necessarily mean you missed. The bad news is that medicine you wiped off your face is wasted by design — and it's well-known to the drug companies that make the drops. Eyedrops overflow our eyes because drug companies make the typical drop — from glaucoma drugs that cost hundreds of dollars to cheap over-the-counter bottles — larger than a human eye can hold. Some are so large that if they were pills, every time you swallowed one, you'd toss another in the garbage. The waste frustrates glaucoma specialists like Dr. Alan Robin, whose patients struggle to make pricey bottles of drops last. He has urged drug companies to move to smaller drops — to no avail. ""They had no interest in people, their pocketbooks or what the cost of drugs meant,"" said Robin, a Baltimore ophthalmologist and adjunct professor at the University of Michigan Medical School. ProPublica has been documenting the many ways money is wasted in health care. We've shown how hospitals throw out brand-new supplies, nursing homes flush tons of unexpired medication and drug companies concoct costly combinations of cheap drugs. Recently we described how arbitrary expiration dates for drugs cause us to toss safe and potent medicine. Often, large swaths of the medical and pharmaceutical communities know about this waste — even about solutions to it — but do nothing. Those who end up paying the bill, in one way or another, are consumers. Crucial eye medications to treat conditions like glaucoma can cost hundreds of dollars for a small bottle that lasts only a month, making the waste of even a drop a problem for low-income patients. Last year, drug companies brought in about $3.4 billion in the U.S. alone on drops for dry eyes and glaucoma drops, according to the research firm Market Scope. Gregory Matthews said there have been times when he has run out of his $295 bottle of Azopt, a glaucoma medication, with a few days remaining before his refill and he has blamed himself. ""You feel like you're doing something that's going to cause your blindness and it's because of you,"" said Matthews, 63, a teacher from Baltimore. Smaller drops are feasible  Pharmaceutical companies have done research showing that it's possible to waste less and save consumers money. Some of that research has been around for decades. Robin, for example, consulted in the early 1990s with Alcon Laboratories, one of the world's largest eye care companies, when its researchers developed a so-called microdrop. Patients, he said, were able to safely and effectively deliver the tiny drops, with nothing wasted. But instead of being a breakthrough, the innovation, he said, became a case study in how business interests trump patient needs. Bill York recalls his bosses at Alcon coming to him in the early 1990s with a pressing request. Patients were complaining that some of the company's drops caused stinging and burning in their eyes. Could he find a fix? York, head of the research lab at the company's Fort Worth, Texas, headquarters, knew one way to ease the irritation: Make the drops smaller. The size of eyedrops isn't regulated, he said recently. Some are over 50 microliters, more than twice what the eye can hold. When drops are too big, the overflow runs down the face or drains into the body through the ducts in the corner of the eye, he said. This explains why you sometimes get the sensation of ""tasting"" eyedrops — they've entered your sinuses. ""If it spills out, it's just wasted,"" said York, who has a doctorate in pharmaceutical chemistry and is now retired. ""It's not doing any good."" So his team created a 16-microliter drop — a microdrop — that was about a half to a third of the size of most drops on the market today, he said. The team used a standard bottle with a latex dropper tip that wouldn't cause injury if it touched the eye. Then they recruited 29 glaucoma patients to test the tiny drops. Glaucoma, a leading cause of blindness in the United States, is characterized by increased pressure in the eye, which can damage the optic nerve. Daily use of medicated eyedrops preserves sight by reducing the pressure. The patients tried different formulations of the same medication in both micro- and regular drops, which were about twice as large, for a week at a time. The researchers tracked the patients' eye pressure and side effects, such as burning, stinging, itching and dryness. 
                Matthews has health insurance that pays for his Azopt prescription drops, but those without insurance pay about $295 per bottle.

 Matthews has health insurance that pays for his Azopt prescription drops, but those without insurance pay about $295 per bottle. Their results were conclusive: Microdrops worked as well as larger drops to lower eye pressure. They also reduced some of the uncomfortable side effects of larger drops. And all the patients preferred using them. York and two of his Alcon colleagues published their results in 1992 in the American Journal of Ophthalmology. Robin, who consulted on the research, was the principal investigator. ""The microdrop delivery system worked,"" York said recently. The drop ""was manufacturable. It reduced stinging and the amount of drug needed to produce the same biologic effect. Excess drug draining out of the eye would be significantly reduced."" Would smaller drops lower sales?  But his innovative solution ground to a halt when it came to getting it on the market. Back in the early 1990s, Jerry Cagle was the head of product development at Alcon. Cagle, who has a doctorate in microbiology, retired in 2008 after 32 years at the company. He said the microdrop project failed because it raised too many questions — all of them about profits. First, would competitors in the cutthroat eye care business undermine the project? One time, Cagle recalled, Alcon wrapped one of its bottles in foil to reduce evaporation, extending the life of the product. A competing company started a rumor that Alcon's drops needed the foil because they were toxic. Alcon had to remove the foil. ""No good deed goes unpunished,"" Cagle said. Second, if Alcon reduced the drop size on this product, would it have to do the same on the company's other eyedrops? And maybe most crucially, how would the microdrops affect sales? Microdrops, Cagle recalled, had ""the potential to increase the use-life of a bottle by a factor of two,"" which could cut sales in half. But if they raised the price on the bottle to recover revenue, Cagle said, ""then what's a competitor going to say? 'Look at Alcon's product. It's twice as expensive as ours.' "" Alcon would also have to get Food and Drug Administration approval. Company-funded studies would need to prove to the agency that the smaller drop was just as effective as a larger drop. So the project was killed, Cagle recalled, doomed by the cost of bringing the microdrops to market, combined with the risks of whether they would sell. ""I'm a believer in small drops, don't get me wrong,"" Cagle said. ""If this had been an innovation we thought would have increased Alcon's sales, I think it would be in the marketplace today."" Novartis, which now owns Alcon, didn't want to talk about the microdrop study. When asked about the drop size, a spokesperson said the drops include a ""margin of safety"" to ensure patients get enough of the drug in their eyes. Robin recalled a different response in the 1990s when he urged Alcon executives to pursue the microdrop. It was, he said, like asking your wife if you could leave town for your anniversary or her birthday. ""It was a dead issue,"" Robin said. ""They would say, 'It's not profitable. We're going to sell less drugs.' Very simple. Bottom line."" Drugmakers have long known drops were oversize Twenty-five years later, things haven't changed. Those in the eye care industry — doctors, pharmaceutical officials, researchers — know that eyedrops are much larger than the eye can hold. But there's little focus on the waste. Dr. Michael Repka, spokesman for the American Academy of Ophthalmology, said the drops have been larger than the eye's capacity for the three decades he has been in practice. While the focus has been on drop administration and ensuring patients can get refills, he said, the industry should be looking at drop size. You might think the FDA would intercede, but the agency's mission is the safety and efficacy of drugs, not prices or indirect costs due to waste. Since Alcon's mothballed research in the early 1990s, other studies have similarly found that most drops on the market are larger than necessary. A 2006 study published in the Journal of Ocular Pharmacology and Therapeutics, for example, said 15-microliter drops are as effective as large drops. ""Smaller drops would be preferable to minimize systemic exposure and spilled or wasted medicine,"" the study said. Two of its authors worked for the pharmaceutical giant Allergan, which also funded the study. Allergan still doesn't make any drops that are 15 microliters or smaller. The company declined to comment. Another study published in May in the journal BMC Ophthalmology said ""a significant portion of an eyedrop is wasted."" Internal drug company documents and depositions unearthed in a recent court case in Illinois also suggest that companies have long known their eyedrops are bigger than human eyes can absorb. A 2002 Bausch &amp; Lomb memo said dropper tips ""deliver drops which exceed that of which the physiology of the eye can retain."" A 2011 Pfizer memo said: ""The drop size is not a medical dosing issue because the human eye can only absorb 7 (microliters) of fluid."" Common drop sizes are between 25 and 56 microliters, the memo added. And in a 2014 deposition, a scientist from Allergan acknowledged that the company studied glaucoma drops of 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 microliters in size and found no statistically significant difference in the ability of the drops to reduce eye pressure. None of the drug companies wanted to discuss these documents or why they haven't pursued a smaller drop. Even a drug industry consultant, Gary Novack, said it would be ideal to have a smaller drop with a higher concentration of medicine. But Novack, a pharmacology expert who helps companies shepherd products to market, doesn't believe reducing the size of drops would lower health care costs. The drug companies, he said, would ""acclimate,"" raising prices by charging by dose instead of volume. Big drops strain pocketbooks It isn't hard to find patients who are feeling the cost of this waste. David Zinke, 67, lamented on Facebook that he couldn't afford the $185 per month drops his doctor had just prescribed. He was shocked to hear about microdrops. He always thought ""a drop was a drop."" Zinke said he was getting by on his Social Security plus what he made by selling fudge and driving for Uber in Tucson, Ariz., clearing about $1,500 a month. His budget doesn't cover the brand-name drug, so every day he uses three less expensive bottles of drops.

 Matthews' prescription drops keep his eye pressure down. Not using the eyedrops could lead to blindness. ""If we could deliver it in a smaller and more appropriate way,"" he said, ""then that little bottle of 2.5 milliliters would last me two months instead of one."" Matthews, the teacher in Baltimore who fears running out of his drops, carefully puts a single drop of Azopt into each eye twice a day to preserve his remaining eyesight. His glaucoma has left him almost completely blind in one eye and partially blind in the other. The drops allow him to continue to work as a teacher and watch his beloved Baltimore Orioles. Azopt is made by Alcon. Matthews has good insurance, so he doesn't pay the $295 sticker price. But he can't get a refill until after the insurer figures his supply should have lasted, so it's critical not to waste a single drop. But no matter how hard he tries, the drug gets wasted. Each drop is more like a milky ""gob"" that collects in the corner of his eye. ""Sometimes I feel like I'm wiping half of it out,"" he said. As he talked about the size of eyedrops, Matthews grew more irritated. ""This whole blind thing takes some getting used to,"" he said. ""If the maker of the medicine isn't really looking out for me, that bothers me."" ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom based in New York.

npr,"October 17, 2017","If You Want An IUD, Take Note Of Trump's New Birth Control Policy"," Most employers are likely to continue paying for birth control for women. But there are exceptions. The Trump administration has made a number of changes to health policy in the past two weeks, raising questions about how consumers will be affected. Will the new rules for birth control coverage affect access to an intrauterine device? Might an association health plan help bring down costs for workers at small businesses? And if you're healthy, doesn't a short-term health plan that is cheaper than marketplace coverage make sense? Here are some answers to those questions. IUDs are expensive. Will they be unaffordable under the new contraceptive rules announced by the Trump administration? Should people make an appointment to get one now before employers change their minds about coverage?  There is probably no need to rush out to your doctor's office to get an IUD, but you should keep an eye on this issue. Under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, most health plans are required to cover all methods of birth control approved by the Food and Drug Administration without charging women anything for them. Religious employers and some private employers with strong religious objections are exempt from the requirement, but it's a pretty limited group. Or it was until the Trump administration issued new rules during the first week of October that open the door for many companies or nonprofit organizations with religious or moral objections to contraception to stop offering it. ""These new exemptions are sweeping,"" says Adam Sonfield, a senior policy manager at the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health research organization. Essentially, any employer will be able to claim an exemption from the birth control coverage requirement, he says, and there are no provisions to appeal it. What is not at all clear, however, is how many employers will take advantage of the new rules. The administration says it expected the number to be small, probably just the companies that had brought suit against the old rules. Even before the ACA passed, many plans covered contraception. They didn't necessarily cover all FDA-approved methods, however, and women typically had to pay a share of the cost. Several states have laws that protect birth control coverage, says Mara Gandal-Powers, senior counsel at the National Women's Law Center. Some require that if a plan offers prescription drug coverage, for example, it must cover contraceptives. Others have adopted the ACA rules that require coverage of all FDA-approved methods without cost-sharing. But those laws would not apply to employers that pay their employees' health care claims directly rather than buy state-regulated insurance. The protection from cost-sharing is key, experts say, especially for highly effective methods like the IUD, which might cost $1,000 upfront. ""Even if you've met your deductible, if you have 20 percent coinsurance, that's $200, and for many people, that's not feasible,"" Gandal-Powers says. If your employer does decide to stop providing insurance coverage for contraception, in most cases, plans have to give workers 60 days' advance notice of the benefit change, giving you time to get that IUD if you decide to. Association health plans, which the Trump administration is encouraging, seem like kind of a good idea. If more small companies band together, won't that make coverage cheaper?  President Trump signed an executive order on Thursday that directs several federal agencies to consider proposing rules that, among other things, would allow more employers to buy health insurance through associations. If you're young and healthy, getting coverage through an association health plan might indeed be cheaper. But you'll likely forgo consumer protections that are required for plans sold on the individual and small-group markets, says Kevin Lucia, a research professor at Georgetown University's Center on Health Insurance Reforms. Plans currently sold in those markets have to cover 10 so-called essential health benefits. Association health plans would likely sidestep that requirement. (However, implementing federal rules for these plans will take the administration some time, so it's not clear if or when they might be expanded.) ""If you don't cover maternity, mental health or hospitalization, the premiums are going to be lower,"" Lucia says. The administration's press release about the executive order says that employers couldn't exclude any employees from joining association health plans or ""develop premiums based on health conditions."" But association health plans have been known to use many strategies to cherry-pick employers with healthy workforces, Lucia says. ""The risk is that each individual small-employer's rates would be separately determined based on its employees' medical claims, potentially splitting the market into employers with sicker workers and those whose workers are healthier,"" he says. Short-term plans are cheaper than Obamacare plans. If people don't have pre-existing conditions and are willing to pay the penalty under the law for not having minimum coverage, what's the downside?  Trump's executive order that encouraged the expansion of association health plans, discussed above, also aims to expand the availability of short-term plans. Under Obama administration rules, the coverage period of short-term plans was limited to less than three months. This executive order proposes to expand that, perhaps to just under a year. In addition to not covering pre-existing conditions, short-term plans often exclude certain types of coverage, such as prescription drugs and maternity, and impose dollar limits on coverage. The maximum out-of-pocket spending limits are often higher than coverage in a marketplace plan too. The potential downside is the possibility that you may develop a medical condition or have an accident that requires expensive medical care while you're covered under this plan, experts say. ""If the reader has a car accident, the insurer wouldn't renew the policy,"" says Timothy Jost, a professor emeritus of law at Washington and Lee University in Virginia who is an expert on health law. ""If coverage is terminated, you're not eligible for a special enrollment period [on the exchange]. So you could just get marooned.""

npr,"October 16, 2017",Floating Away Your Anxiety And Stress," Yes — spend an hour in a dark, soundproof room floating in a body-temperature warm pool. ""The heavy salt concentration does the work for you,"" my friend told me. ""You just lie there and meditate."" As a doctor wary of overprescribing medications, I was intrigued by the idea that floating can combat stress and anxiety, but I wanted to know if there's any science to back up this claim. So I visited the lab of neuropsychologist Justin Feinstein at the Laureate Institute for Brain Research in Tulsa, Okla. Feinstein is investigating float therapy as a nonpharmacological treatment for people with conditions like anxiety and depression. ""These are individuals with PTSD disorder, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety — we covered the whole spectrum of different types of anxiety,"" he says. Before volunteers get in the pool, Feinstein maps their brains using functional MRI, which provides images of the brain's metabolic activity. Feinstein takes images again after a 60-minute float. And he's finding that floating seems to quiet activity in the amygdala, the brain's center of fear and anxiety. Feinstein asked if I wanted to try it, so after a quick shower, I jumped right in.

 A staff member demonstrates the float tank used for studies at the Laureate Institute for Brain Research in Tulsa, Okla. The round pool is 1 foot deep, 8 feet in diameter, and saturated with 1,332 pounds of magnesium sulfate, commonly known as Epsom salt. It holds you up like a mattress. The room is soundproof, the lights are off and you just lay back and float. Floating made me feel weightless; it's kind of like being suspended in air. I could feel my muscles relaxing. There was one exception — I noticed how clenched my jaw was, probably my natural state of being. I really had to focus on letting it relax. It took a while to let my thoughts quiet down, but eventually I was so relaxed I fell asleep—while floating! While this sounds promising, it's important to remember that this research is preliminary. One of Feinstein's pilot studies, which is currently under review for publication, found that in 50 individuals with anxiety, all showed measurable signs of relaxation including lowered blood pressure, lowered activity in the brain, and significantly reduced symptoms of anxiety. Feinstein has found that some of these effects can last over 24 hours. The Float Clinic and Research Center has many other ongoing studies and another currently under review for publication. Even though floating isn't a proven treatment, more and more commercial float centers are opening across the country, including the H2Oasis Float Center and Tea House, which opened here in Tulsa a little over a year ago. It uses the same open pools that were designed for Feinstein's lab as well as small, enclosed float pods which can be claustrophobic for some people. A one-hour float session costs between $50 and $70. ""At the very minimum, you are going to have one of the most relaxing hours of your life,"" says Debra Worthington, co-owner of the facility. She says that many people come here trying to float their anxieties away — injured athletes, veterans with PTSD, people with chronic pain and anxiety. ""I have people leaving the pools crying because they never knew they could feel that good because they have so much pain on a daily basis, whether it's physical pain or mental pain,"" Worthington says. While medication is beneficial for many anxiety and mood disorders, many classes of the drugs are habit-forming, and all have side effects that patients often find unpleasant. So while floating isn't a proven therapy, there's little harm in trying to float some of that stress away.

npr,"October 16, 2017",Mindfulness Apps Aim To Help People Disconnect From Stress," From fires and hurricanes, to confrontational politics — with all that's been going on, it's no wonder the American Psychological Association found an increase in Americans' stress levels over the last year. Our constant checking of smartphones — with the bombardment of news and social media — can amp up our anxiety. So, why not use your device to help you disconnect? Mindfulness apps, such as Simply Being, are an increasingly popular way to help manage stress. Using this app, you can tap into a soundtrack of soothing sounds to help clear your mind. (Cue babbling brook, singing birds, meditation gongs!) The idea behind mindfulness is simple to explain, but hard to execute. The goal is to focus on the present moment, and to let go of regrets of the past or worries about the future. And some researchers say apps can be a useful tool to assist this practice. ""I think they can be helpful,"" says Dr. Stuart Eisendrath, a psychiatrist at the University of California, San Francisco who researches Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy. ""There are a variety of apps out there,"" Eisendrath says. ""Some of them are just simple meditation timers"" to help users stay focused for a specific period of time. The UCSF Student Health and Counseling Center lists several of these apps, including Zazen and I-Qi, on its Mindfulness Meditation website. Some of the documented benefits of mindfulness meditation, according the UCSF site, can include better management of chronic pain, an increase in self-awareness, improved digestion and higher immune function. But here's the rub: There's no evidence that just using a mindfulness app will bring these benefits. ""Everybody wants a quick fix, they want to know the shortest, fastest root to be mindful,"" says Steven Hickman, a psychologist and founder of the UC San Diego Center for Mindfulness. He says just using an app for a few minutes, a few times a week is likely not enough. ""It really does take ongoing practice — just like exercise,"" Hickman says. Therapists say people should be skeptical if they download an app that makes specific health claims, and shouldn't use them as a replacement for therapy. ""Few of these apps are empirically validated,"" says Jason Parcover, who directs the counseling center at Loyola University Maryland. And they can't yet be tailored to a user's specific needs. A recent perspective piece published in the British Medical Journal points to the need for more rigorous review of apps. The authors say people who use apps should know if there's evidence to back up claims made by the app developers. Consumers, they say, need to be taught ""to look for signals of quality before downloading."" The U.K.'s National Health Service is in the process of evaluating apps that might help manage or even improve health. So far, the listed apps include Chill Panda, which gives users simple breathing techniques and light exercises to ""take your mind off worries,"" according to its developers. Another one, Stress &amp; Anxiety Companion, is billed as a way to help people handle stress and anxiety on the go. When it comes to building a mindfulness meditation practice, ""there's no substitute for a live connection with a teacher — and encouragement from a group or class,"" Hickman says. But for people who have already taken a class or been introduced to the basics, he says, ""apps are a terrific support to the process."" Parcover agrees that apps can be an effective ""nudge"" — a reminder to keep it up daily, or a few times a week. ""One of the struggles is having the discipline to build meditation into your lifestyle,"" he says. ""I know these apps are popular with students."" Given the bombardment of the digital world, Parcover says, and all the daily stresses, many students recognize the value of ""finding the time to be present in the here and now.""

npr,"October 15, 2017",'Quackery' Chronicles How Our Love Of Miracle Cures Leads Us Astray," Since the beginning of time, humans have been searching for ways to make ourselves feel better fast. Unfortunately, history has shown that many of those ways — cannibalism, cocaine tooth drops, ingesting heavy metals — left us sick, broke, or both. Yet we keep looking for that fast cure. Dr. Lydia Kang, an author and a primary care physician in Omaha, Neb., is the co-author of Quackery: A Brief History Of The Worst Ways To Cure Everything, which publishes Oct. 17. She talked to us recently about her new book, the gross things people have done through the centuries in search of health, and what it means for modern medicine. As a culture, we are always looking for a quick fix, especially for our health. ""We are so used to getting things immediately, it's hard to be patient and wait,"" says Kang. A Brief History of the Worst Ways to Cure Everything by Lydia Kang and Nate Pedersen Hardcover, 342 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? ""We're always trying so hard as people to just feel better. We want normal, we want function. When something goes a little off, we are really, really eager to get back."" That may have especially been true before physicians truly understood physiology. And before Google. ""Let's be honest. People don't go to their doctors first,"" Kang says. From ancient times through Victorian times, people believed in humoral medicine, the idea that balancing a body's humors or fluids helped maintain health. Black bile (melancholy), yellow or red bile, blood, and phlegm had to be kept in harmony, or the person would become ill. This led to bloodletting, induced vomiting, and a host of other practices that launched industrieThs for leeches, vomiting chalices, tapeworm pills and the like. 
                Tape worm pills were once advertised as a way to stay thin.

 Tape worm pills were once advertised as a way to stay thin. The book includes many examples of people falling for false cures. Cocaine was used to soothe tooth pain, develop a feel-good soft drink called Coca-Cola, and likely inspired and provide fuel for the author of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde before we realized it was addictive. Using ice picks to operate on the brains of desperate and unfortunate patients with mental health issues sounds like a bad idea now, but the illnesses that drove people to try it persist. ""Depression is still a major, major problem,"" Kang notes, ""It's probably more frustrating that we have so far to go."" Another bad idea was ingesting metal. Heavy metal pills were so popular in the 1800s that even the future President Lincoln took a pill called ""blue mass"" that was essentially some flavorings mixed with mercury to ""cure"" his headaches, mood swings, and constipation, according to Quackery. Lincoln apparently recognized at some point that the pills were making things worse, and actually ramped down his dose while in office. ""One shudders to imagine a mercury-toxic, pathologically moody leader of our nation calling the shots during the Civil War,"" the book notes wryly. Mercury ointments and pills was also a common and unsuccessful treatment for syphilis, which plagued humans from the 1400s until the early 20th century, when penicillin was finally called in. "" Similarly, for decades, people thought taking gold pills would cure them of a variety of illnesses. Kang says she can see the logic. ""Sun is warm. Gold is like the sun. If we can put something gold in a drink, we can be healthy ... Gold never tarnishes."" In one of the odder stories in the book, Kang finds that in the 18th century, people believed a tobacco smoke enema could revive drowning victims. ""Instead of putting a life preserver on the side of the bank by the Thames, they put this bellows kit,"" Kang says, because they believed it would warm the victim and stimulate respiration. Since it did neither, the practice later led to the phrase, ""blowing smoke up your arse,"" i.e. giving someone an insincere compliment. Kang's favorite ""cure"" in the book is the concept of cannibalism as medicine. ""I'm always afraid to say that out loud ... people will look at me funny,"" Kang says. Why did people think it worked? ""You are what you eat ... if you can consume something that was full of vitality, then you can be full of vitality."" We're still not completely scientifically-minded when it comes to medicine. When a new (or old) idea comes along and someone we know or admire swears it makes them feel better, we are more likely to go for it, says Kang. ""I wish people had a better understanding of bias confirmation — feeling sick and wanting desperately for your bad back to feel better changes your objectivity,"" she says. As a doctor, Kang tries to convince her patients to research their ideas carefully without talking down to them or shaming them. She recommends reading through a few good medical websites and having long chat with your doctor before attempting anything that might potentially hurt you.

npr,"October 14, 2017",New Rule On Moral Objections To Contraception Aimed At 2 Groups," People in the March for Life near the National Mall in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 27. Few people were surprised last week when the Trump administration issued a rule to make it easier for some religious employers to opt out of offering no-cost prescription birth control to their female employees under the Affordable Care Act. But a separate regulation issued at the same time raised eyebrows. It creates a new exemption from the requirement that most employers offer contraceptive coverage. This one is for ""non-religious organizations with sincerely held moral convictions inconsistent with providing coverage for some or all contraceptive services."" So what's the difference between religious beliefs and moral convictions? ""Theoretically, it would be someone who says 'I don't have a belief in God' but 'I oppose contraception for reasons that have nothing to do with religion or God,' "" says Mark Rienzi, a senior counsel for the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, which represented many of the organizations that sued the Obama administration over the contraceptive mandate. Nicholas Bagley, a law professor at the University of Michigan, says it would apply to ""an organization that has strong moral convictions but does not associate itself with any particular religion."" What kind of an organization would that be? It turns out not to be such a mystery, Rienzi and Bagley agreed. Among the hundreds of organizations that sued over the mandate, two — the Washington, D.C.-based March for Life and the Pennsylvania-based Real Alternatives — are anti-abortion groups that don't qualify for religious exemptions. While their employees may be religious, the groups themselves are not. March for Life argued that the ACA requirement to cover all contraceptives approved by the Food and Drug Administration includes methods that prevent a fertilized egg from implanting in a woman's uterus and therefore are a type of abortion. Real Alternatives opposes the use of all contraceptives. March for Life, which coordinates an annual abortion protest each year, won its suit before a federal district court judge in Washington, D.C. But a federal appeals court ruled in August that Real Alternatives, which offers counseling services to help women choose not to have an abortion, does not qualify as a religious entity and thus can't claim the exemption. That decision cited a lower court ruling that ""finding a singular moral objection to law on par with a religious objection could very well lead to a flood of similar objections."" The departments of Treasury, Labor and Health and Human Services, however, suggest that, at least in this case, that will not happen. The regulation issued by those departments says officials ""assume the exemption will be used by nine nonprofit entities"" and ""nine for-profit entities."" Among the latter, it says, ""we estimate that 15 women may incur contraceptive costs due to for-profit entities using the expanded exemption provided"" in the rules. The regulation also seeks comments on whether the moral exemption should be extended to publicly traded firms. Rienzi agrees that the universe for the moral exemption is likely to be small. ""The odds that anyone new is going to come up and say 'Aha, I finally have my way out,' "" he says, ""is crazy."" Women's health advocates, however, are not so sure. ""The parameters of what constitutes a moral objection is unclear,"" says Mara Gandal-Powers, senior counsel at the National Women's Law Center, which is preparing to sue to stop both rules. ""There is nothing in the regulatory language itself that says what a moral belief is that would rise to the level of making an organization eligible for the exemption."" Louise Melling, deputy legal director at the American Civil Liberties Union, which has already filed a lawsuit, agrees. ""We don't know how many other entities are out there that would assert a moral objection,"" she says. ""Not everybody wanted to file a suit,"" particularly smaller organizations. All of that, however, presupposes that the rule laying out the moral objection exemption will stand up in court. Bagley says he's doubtful. The legal arguments making the case for the exemption, he says, are ""the kind of things that would be laughed out of a [first-year] class on statutory interpretation."" Specifically, he says, the rule lays out all the times Congress has included provisions in laws for moral objections. But rather than justifying the case, ""it suggests that Congress knew a lot about how to craft a moral objection if it wanted to,"" and it did not in the health law, he noted. Bagley says the fact that the moral exemption was laid out in a separate rule from the religious one demonstrates that the administration is concerned the former might not stand up to court proceedings. ""The administration must sense this rule is on thin legal ice,"" he says. Which leads to the question of why Trump officials even bothered doing a separate rule. Bagley says he thinks the act was more political than substantive. ""The administration is doing something that signals to religious employers ... that they are on their sides, that they have their backs.""

Air pollution in counties of the San Francisco Bay Area this week has been the worst since 1999 when officials began collecting data. ""The pollution is so high it's comparable to high pollution days in China,"" says Lisa Fasano at the Bay Area Air Quality Management District. The worst hour so far was measured on Tuesday in Napa, Calif., with an Air Quality Index of 404 for small particulate matter — so high it's off the chart, as you can see below. Source: Bay Area Air Quality Management District Credit: KQED Officials warn that very fine smoke particles, a fraction of the size of a human hair, can lodge in the lungs and, particularly in some vulnerable populations, do damage. ""When we breathe particulates, they bypass the lung system and get into our bloodstream,"" says Fasano. ""They exacerbate respiratory conditions like asthma, [chronic obstructive pulmonary disease], emphysema and other conditions, because they are very harmful."" Source: AirNow Credit: KQED A seasonal inversion layer is putting a lid on the pollution and holding it in the region. Usually the Bay Area benefits from a natural air conditioning system with winds blowing in off the coast and carrying the air inland. Residents in the North Bay are experiencing the brunt of the pollution because of nearby wildfires in California's wine country. Residents in Napa, Solano and Sonoma counties should try to stay inside buildings with air conditioning. But people in the East Bay and South Bay are not completely in the clear because the toxic air is creeping all over the region. You can look up your ZIP code here and find a five-day forecast here. Source: AirNow Credit: KQED ""We are also seeing elevated levels in San Francisco and Redwood City,"" says Fasano. ""We are all being impacted by this really unhealthy air pollution."" Fasano recommends buying a face mask at the hardware store with an N-95 rating or higher. Unfortunately neither a hospital mask nor a bandanna tied over the face prevents noxious air from entering the lungs, and to make much of a difference, even N-95 masks must fit well. Fasano suggests staying inside as much as possible while skies are smoky to avoid breathing both particle pollution and ash wafting through the air.

Its report also cites positive data in exports and federal government spending. Welcoming the news, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said via a statement, ""With unemployment at a 16-year low, the stock market at new highs and economic confidence soaring, the U.S. economy is surging under this President's leadership."" Sanders added that for growth to continue, Congress should adopt the Trump administration's approach to changing the tax code. Analysts had predicted a possible slowdown, after Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria brought extensive problems and slowed economic activity in Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico and other areas. Before those catastrophic storms hit, economists had been expecting an even stronger showing for the third quarter — as high as nearly 4 percent, according to the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank's GDP Now forecast. Reporting on Friday's numbers, John says that a big surge in inventories added by businesses was the main reason third-quarter growth exceeded expectations.

npr,"October 27, 2017",Sen. John Thune On Republican Tax Plan," (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BOB CORKER: I think the debasement of our nation will be what he'll be remembered most for. GREENE: That was Corker there. Now, Senator John Thune of South Dakota is the third-ranking Republican in the Senate. And I spoke with him about those tensions in the party. We began, though, with the GOP's argument that their tax plan is going to bring relief to middle-class families. JOHN THUNE: I think you're going to see, when this thing actually is written, that if you're a middle-income taxpayer, you're going to benefit from a doubling of the standard deduction. You're going to benefit from lower rates. You're going to benefit from an expansion of the child tax credit. And then also, you're going to get the added benefit of the higher wages that come from reducing the taxes on businesses in this country that enable them to invest and expand their businesses. GREENE: I'm glad you brought that up. I mean, the argument from the White House and Republicans is that most of the savings from corporate tax cuts will ultimately flow to workers. The Congressional Budget Office, the Joint Committee on Taxation - they disagree. They say the lion's share of the savings will go to the business owners. Many of them are upper income. So I mean, which side are you on here? THUNE: Well, I think that there are - frankly, there are limited options that you have. If you're a business and you end up paying less in taxes, you can plow that back into the business. You can pay it out in dividends to shareholders. You can raise employees' wages. And different organizations come to different conclusions, but all agree that at least some benefit of that is going to go back to employees in the form of higher wages. GREENE: I want to ask you about some of the criticism from fellow Republican senators about President Trump in recent days. Do you agree that the president is debasing this country? THUNE: Well, I think that the - I think the president has an entirely different style, unlike anything we've seen before. I'm not a big fan, frankly, of his use of social media platforms to get his message out. But many people are very active on social media platforms, and a lot of them get their information that way. And so that's how he communicates. GREENE: It wasn't just about social media. I mean, you - I want to remind people - were one of the earliest Republicans to call for Donald Trump to actually drop out of the campaign after that ""Access Hollywood"" tape was revealed. So is - do you still have some serious concerns that we heard about back then? THUNE: Well, look, I mean, I - there at that particular time, yes, I thought that it was going to be very difficult for him to recover from some of those things. But, you know, it became eventually a binary choice between him and Hillary Clinton. And obviously, he represents an agenda. And the things in terms of policy that I want to accomplish sync up with this president way more than they would have with Hillary Clinton. But now that he's been elected president, we have an opportunity to do some good things for the American people. GREENE: Are you worried, though, that the Republican agenda could actually suffer and be imperiled if you continue to have Republican colleagues who are deeply concerned about the president and make that known and cause these kinds of rifts? THUNE: I think that there are always going to be differences of opinion and disagreements, and that's true in any family. But I just think it's better, if you can, keep those in-the-family feuds and fights within the family. GREENE: You're saying Senator Flake and Senator Bob Corker should have kept their concerns to themselves? THUNE: No, I just think that it would have been better if, you know, either sides in some of these disputes, if they would just have those conversations in private rather than having them in public. Senator Corker has strongly held views, as did Senator Flake. You know, both, of course, are now leaving the Senate. But those of us who are still here, I think, have a responsibility to do the best job we can to try and get results. GREENE: Well, let me finish with a final question about results. One of the president's campaign advisers, economists Stephen Moore, actually said on our air that the party is going to look incompetent if they can't get a win on taxes. Do you agree with that? THUNE: Well, I think that we need to get a win. And we're going to be held accountable by the American people, and we should be. We had a failure on health care. I don't think that issue's going away because I think Obamacare continues to - the markets continue to collapse and premiums continue to skyrocket. So we're going to be revisiting that issue. But right now, the focus is tax reform. If we don't deliver on that, then I think, yeah. I think we're going to pay a price for that. GREENE: Republican Senator John Thune of South Dakota joining us from his Senate office. Senator, thanks for taking our questions. We appreciate it. THUNE: Thanks, David. Copyright © 2017 NPR.

npr,"October 26, 2017",How Important Is It Politically To Keep 401(k) Breaks Unchanged?," The problem here is not cutting taxes. If you're a Republican, you can favor that. The problem is eliminating which deductions so the federal deficit does not increase. That's a tough question. One notion on the table, maybe, is limiting contributions to tax-sheltered 401(k) retirement plans. President Trump says no. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: 401(k)s, to me, are very important. And they're important because that's one of the great benefits to the middle class. I didn't want that to go too far. That's why I ended it very quickly. INSKEEP: But then the president said 401(k)s could be a point of negotiation. Stephen Moore is on the line. He's a fellow with The Heritage Foundation and a former adviser to the Trump presidential campaign. Mr. Moore, welcome back to the program. STEPHEN MOORE: Hi, Steve. Great to be with you. INSKEEP: What's the basic problem that Republicans are wrestling with here? MOORE: First of all, let me say, when you said that this is like, you know, for Republicans, Obamacare repeal, boy, I sure hope it isn't because for Republicans, that didn't work out in the end like that. INSKEEP: (Laughter) That didn't work out very well. MOORE: Right, so this - but that - but by the way, the fact that Republicans failed on the Obamacare repeal really doubles and triples the political stakes for Republicans to get this done. And I truly think that they just about have to have this happen, or else they're going to look very incompetent to voters. It's a... INSKEEP: But it is a similar situation - right, Stephen? - because they need almost every Republican vote. They could only lose a few of them in the Senate. They want to do this without Democratic support. MOORE: That's right. INSKEEP: And when you get down to the details, they don't agree on them. MOORE: Well, you're exactly right. I mean, how do you get the 50 votes in the Senate? And that's the same issue they faced in - with Obamacare where they came up with one vote short with 49. So they - it looks pretty good right now. The - every Republican voted for the budget resolution last year, which is what sort of was the enabling legislation to get the tax cut going. And what's happening right now is, the sausage-making is going on in Congress where they're trying to figure out - a mad scramble to figure out, what are they going to put in this tax bill? What're they going to take out? That issue of the 401(k)s that you mentioned has become a hot-button issue over the last couple of days because as Republicans try to cut the tax rates, they're trying to find, you know, offsets of ways of raising the revenues to pay for the lower rates. And one of the ideas that was floated was to restrict the amount of money put - people could put into these 401(k) accounts. There's something like 50 million people, Steve, that have 401(k)s. And even though, you know, I could make an economic argument for why it might make sense to, you know, lower the rates in exchange for getting rid of the 401(k) deductions, it has not gone over well politically. And I don't think it's going to happen because there's been, you know, outrage by a lot of voters who say, look, I like my 401(k)s. You know, 50 million have them. They must be popular. INSKEEP: Although this is the dilemma for Republicans, isn't it? MOORE: Yeah, it sure is. INSKEEP: ...Because Republicans want to cut taxes. They also - many of them - profess to be concerned about the deficit, and actually, the technicalities of lawmaking here require them not to expand the deficit so much. MOORE: That's right. INSKEEP: Have Republicans lost interest, really, in cutting the deficit? MOORE: Well, I mean, the fact is, they are constrained under that budget that passed last week to the - they can lose up to $1.5 trillion revenue over the next 10 years. Now, that's out of $45 trillion of expected revenue. So that means, when they want to cut something for - let's say, they want to cut the - or double the standard deduction, which is really one of the base proposals. That's an expensive thing to do because that means every taxpayer gets a reduction. That means you're going to have to take away some things from people. And one of the problems they face is that Donald Trump has made very clear - I worked with him on this during the campaign. He said, I want this to be a big tax cut for the middle class. So if you start taking away things from the middle class, you know, that causes a lot of political problems. And it's funny. You know, Steve, I'm old enough to remember in 1986 when Ronald Reagan did the last big tax reform - I mean, reform. And that was bipartisan. This whole issue of 401(k)s and IRA deductions came up then, as well, and that didn't go over well, and they dropped that proposal. Sometimes these ideas come back. There's also, as you know, a big fight over whether to eliminate the state and local tax deduction. And people in these blue states like New York, and California and New Jersey aren't too happy about that. INSKEEP: Yeah, you'd lose a lot of money if you're a taxpayer in New York. So let me get you to answer the basic, broad critique of this tax plan, granting that the details are still coming out. The basic critique from the left, anyway, is that it's a bait and switch, that President Trump talks of supporting the forgotten man, the forgotten American. But then he supports tax cuts for businesses, eliminating an estate tax that only hits the super wealthy. Those are not forgotten people. But according to independent analyses, they're the people who would get the benefits. MOORE: So let's talk about the heart and soul of the plan, which, really, is the reduction in the business tax rate. It - to me, as an economist, and I think most - certainly, conservative economists would agree that the most important thing we need to fix in our tax system is that we have the highest statutory tax rate in the world on our businesses, and that just hurts... INSKEEP: Oh, I got to stop you and remind you that many businesses don't pay that rate. It's not necessarily the highest in the world. MOORE: No, of course, of course. INSKEEP: But go on, go on, go on. MOORE: No, that's absolutely true. So the statutory rate is very high, but for some companies, they pay much lower than that. By the way, I think that's a defect of the system, Steve. We want to set the rate from 35 percent instead of now, at 20. But we want to make sure every company pays 20, right? So we want to make sure that that rate - you get rid of all the special-interest loopholes and so on. And I believe, if you do that, that the people who will benefit will not just be the shareholders of the companies but also will be the workers who - think about, if this works, and I think it will, you get a lot of companies moving back to the United States, jobs moving back in the United States to places like Michigan, and Ohio and Pennsylvania. And that means more jobs and higher wages. So we believe that the average worker will benefit to the tune of about three or $4 thousand a year and a higher paycheck from the additional jobs. INSKEEP: And that's got to be the bottom line of the discussion for now, but there's going to be a lot more to say about it. Stephen Moore, always a pleasure talking with you. Thank you very much. MOORE: Thank you, Steve. INSKEEP: He's with The Heritage Foundation. Copyright © 2017 NPR.  All rights reserved.

npr,"October 25, 2017",Next Fed Chair Will Help Determine Pace Of Interest Rate Hikes," President Trump says he is very close to making a decision about who will lead the Federal Reserve once Janet Yellen's term expires in February. The Fed chair is often called the second-most-powerful person in Washington, after the president. By steering interest rate policy, the Fed chair affects economic growth, the pace of job creation and inflation.  The Fed also regulates banks and responds to financial crises — it played a massive role in dealing with the Great Recession by cutting interest rates to record lows and buying trillions of dollars in bonds. So it has a big effect on our economic well-being. There are still a handful of names floating around. In an interview on Sunday on Fox Business News, Trump mentioned three names: John Taylor, an economist currently at Stanford University's Hoover Institution; Jerome Powell, a current Fed governor; and Yellen, the current Fed chair. Taylor is probably the easiest candidate to contrast with Yellen. He is the author of something called the Taylor Rule, which is essentially an equation that takes the current growth rate and level of inflation and determines where the Fed should set interest rates. It could put the Fed's decisions on interest rates on autopilot. Some conservatives in Congress have advocated for it.  But critics, including Yellen, say it is not sensitive enough to what is happening in the real world. Taylor has said he would be more flexible than his academic work might suggest. But there's little doubt he would raise interest rates faster than Yellen. Taylor criticized the Fed for holding interest rates too low after the financial crisis, and he continues to believe that. Powell would probably also be inclined to raise rates faster than Yellen, but not by a lot. He is a former investment banker and served as undersecretary of the Treasury under the first President Bush. Of all the candidates, Powell would probably provide the greatest level of continuity with Yellen's approach. Trump could decide to keep Yellen at the Fed. Trump was very critical of her during the presidential campaign, but several times since then he has said he thought she has done a good job. And he repeated that during the Sunday interview on Fox Business News.  ""I also met with Janet Yellen who I like a lot. I really like her a lot,"" Trump said. In some ways that's not surprising. The president is, after all, a former real estate developer. Real estate developers love low interest rates, and low rates have been the hallmark of the Yellen Fed.  So why not stick with Yellen? There are certainly people on Wall Street and in the business community who would be fine with having Yellen reappointed. After all, low rates are good for stocks and many businesses as well. There have been several other names in the mix including Gary Cohn, who heads Trump's National Economic Council at the White House, and Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor.  There are multiple reports, quoting unnamed White House sources, that Trump has told aides Cohn is out of the running and that Trump wants Cohn to remain in the White House and work on the tax overhaul.  Warsh was once considered the front-runner. But he, too, has advocated for higher interest rates. In fact, when he was a Fed governor he criticized the Bernanke Fed for holding rates too low during the response to the financial crisis. Warsh warned that the policy would very likely lead to runaway inflation. That didn't happen. In fact, inflation has stayed extremely low. So Warsh called it wrong. Still, he has continued to be an advocate for higher rates, which Trump doesn't favor.  Some analysts are suggesting that Trump could reappoint Yellen and get his low rates, and then appoint Powell as vice chair, since the position is now open. Doing so would give Trump the interest rate policy he wants but also move a conservative and a Republican into the Fed's No. 2 position.

 In 2012, Republican Gov. Sam Brownback of Kansas pushed reforms through the Legislature that included across-the-board income tax reductions. But rather than boosting the economy, the cuts caused revenues to plummet. Lawmakers now seek to close a $900 million budget gap over the next two years. Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback is notorious for what is known as the Kansas experiment, a bold effort to assert the power of limited government. In 2012, the Republican governor pushed reforms through the state Legislature that dramatically cut income taxes across the board. Brownback boasted the plan would deliver a ""shot of adrenaline"" to the Kansas economy. But the opposite happened. Revenues shrank, and the economy grew more slowly than in neighboring states and the country as a whole. Kansas' bond rating plummeted, and the state cut funding to education and infrastructure. Last year, the Republican-controlled state Legislature voted to roll back the tax cuts, but Kansas is still dealing with the aftermath of this bold experiment. State lawmakers are now seeking to close a $900 million budget gap over the next two years. Burdett Loomis, a political scientist at the University of Kansas, says the experiment was as much a political play as it was about governing. ""My personal thought here is that Brownback came back to Kansas from the [U.S.] Senate to demonstrate that Kansas could be this small government heaven on Earth, that would help him honestly run for president in 2012,"" Loomis says. When Brownback was elected in 2010, Kansas, like many other states, was still struggling to rebound after the Great Recession. ""Well, Kansas for years had been thought of as being somewhat behind other states in the region in terms of growth,"" says Kenneth Kriz, a professor of public finance at Wichita State University. ""There was a push starting really with the first years of the Brownback administration to do something with tax policy to help turn the tide and to make Kansas more attractive as a place to live and do business."" Brownback promised the tax cuts would lead to an extra 22,000 jobs over the next five years. It also reduced the number of tax brackets for individual income from three to two. A key part of the plan slashed to zero the tax rate pass-through businesses pay. Small businesses — such as sole proprietorships, partnerships and S corporations — pay taxes through the individual income tax code, not the corporate one. Under the Kansas plan, the pass-through tax rate was reduced from 7 percent to zero. Kriz says big companies exploited this tax exemption. ""There were a lot of really big companies that were actually [limited liability] like big law firms in this state, oil exploration companies then,"" he says. Others supposedly lied on their tax forms. ""Most famously, a couple of basketball coaches allegedly — although nobody can ever prove this — were alleged to have retitled themselves as independent contractors in order to be able to take advantage of it for their multimillion-dollar incomes,"" Kriz says. The theory of the plan — supply-side or trickle-down economics — is a divisive one. For decades, Republicans have touted the economic theory, which seeks to create growth through lowering taxes and decreasing regulation. ""Any serious model tells you that economic growth always leads to increases in revenues, not reductions in revenue,"" says Arthur Laffer, an economist who advised President Ronald Reagan and the Trump campaign, among others. He helped create the Kansas tax plan and is considered by many to be the father of supply-side economics. But when the tax cuts went into effect in 2014, their failure was seen almost instantly. State revenues plummeted by almost $700 million, Kriz says. ""To put it in context, the state general fund budget is about $6 billion, and so that's 10 percent revenue loss in one year,"" he says. ""That's a lot for any government to have to make [up]."" State lawmakers tried to balance the budget by tapping into reserves and the highway fund. They put construction projects on hold; pension contributions dropped; and Medicaid was cut. The state also refashioned the school funding formula and closed and consolidated several school districts. School funding consumes about half of Kansas' budget. Loomis says the Kansas experiment occurred after a shift in the state Legislature. Since the 1970s, the state government had been moderately conservative and ""pretty much reflected the nature of Kansans,"" he says. Then during the Tea Party wave in 2010 — when hundreds of congressional and state government seats were won by Republicans — the Kansas Legislature moved further right. Brownback, who had served 14 years in the U.S. Senate, was also elected as governor. Because of the state's deficit problems, Brownback did not run for president in 2012, and he barely won re-election in 2014. Republicans in the Legislature voted to overturn his tax cuts with the support of Democrats, who helped override the governor's veto. The 2016 election saw the Kansas Legislature grow more moderate again, Loomis says. ""So you had moderate Republicans who made a resurgence in 2016,"" he says. ""You had Democrats who did well in 2016, but the last few votes in both the Senate and House were really quite conservative Republicans who just sucked that up and said, 'We really need to have revenues or this state is going to be in huge, huge difficulties.' "" Despite the $1.2 billion tax increase that passed last year, the budget mess is far from over. Brownback has been nominated to serve in the Trump administration, and once he is confirmed, Lt. Gov. Jeff Colyer will finish his term. While many experts regard the Kansas tax cuts as a failure, Trump's proposed tax plan echoes Brownback's policy, and many Republicans still embrace the ideology behind it. ""There's lots of economic data that lower taxes mean a much better economic growth,"" Colyer tells Here &amp; Now's Jeremy Hobson. ""I worked for President Ronald Reagan. I saw it firsthand. You know, we see those things on the national level."" The Trump tax overhaul aims to spur revenue by cutting taxes for American businesses and earners, including the wealthiest Americans. The Senate voted last week to further a budget bill needed to advance the plan. The corporate tax cuts proposed — the plan would drop rates from 35 to 20 percent — would increase the typical household income by $3,000 to $7,000 a year, according to a report by the Council of Economic Advisers. But as Washington considers a plan similar to Kansas, Kriz is unconvinced. ""Studies have shown that tax cuts tend to pay anywhere between 10 percent and 30 percent of their costs,"" he says. ""So if we cut taxes by a trillion dollars, we're going to probably get an extra hundred billion back ... in extra revenues from economic growth. But that still leaves $700 [billion] to $900 billion in cuts that will have to be made. Those cuts also have an economic effect in drawing down the economy.""

npr,"October 25, 2017",How Disasters Impact Ambition," It's just incredible, the series of natural disasters we've been through, isn't it? We saw deadly fires here in California, hurricanes in Puerto Rico and Texas and Florida. Across the U.S., people are rebuilding homes and businesses and schools. But let's talk about a different kind of damage, to people's sense that they can plan for the future. A study suggests, after disasters, a kind of psychic shock can be even more lasting. Here's NPR's Nurith Aizenman. NURITH AIZENMAN, BYLINE: Marcia Bauer owns a feed and gear store serving cattle ranchers around the rural Texas town of Winnie. Before Hurricane Harvey hit this summer, she was investing a lot of money to attract more customers, getting involved in horse competitions, agricultural festivals... MARCIA BAUER: And then I just had an electronic sign installed to help boost my business. It hadn't been up a month before the hurricane hit. AIZENMAN: Bauer's business ground to a halt, but she thinks eventually things will pick up. For her, long term, the biggest casualty could be her ambition for her business. Bauer says from now on her focus will probably just be on building up emergency reserves. BAUER: Like I told my husband, I said I just - I've given up on setting goals because you take one step forward, three steps backwards. AIZENMAN: A new study suggests this kind of reaction by people, scaling back their aspirations and the economic choices they make as a result, could be a common effect of natural disasters. The evidence comes from Pakistan, which in 2010 went through a sort of Harvey of its own. KATRINA KOSEC: There was a massive flood that was larger than any flood the country had seen in about 80 years. AIZENMAN: Katrina Kosec is an economist at the International Food Policy Research Institute and one of the authors of the study. KOSEC: You literally had a fifth of the country under water. AIZENMAN: And as with so many of the recent disasters in the U.S., the floods in Pakistan felt out of the blue. KOSEC: Communities got a shock that they couldn't have anticipated. AIZENMAN: A year and a half after the flood, Kosec and her collaborator surveyed about a thousand households in those communities and a virtually identical group of households that had not gone through the flood. KOSEC: So you're comparing individuals with the same amount of income, the same amount of assets that might fuel their future hopes and dreams. AIZENMAN: And they asked them about those hopes and dreams. How much annual income do they eventually hope to make? How many years of schooling do they want for their kids? The results, recently published in the journal World Development, the flood survivors had much lower aspirations. What's more, says Kosec... KOSEC: A fatalism really took hold. AIZENMAN: The flood survivors were less likely to do things that might expand their businesses, like taking loans. But the study also found that there's something that can counter the fatalism, and here's how this applies to the U.S. KOSEC: All of the negative effects of the floods in Pakistan on people's aspirations are coming from those communities in which the government did not come in to support people. AIZENMAN: People who had the cushion of even just a little government aid, they held on to their aspirations. Nurith Aizenman, NPR News. Copyright © 2017 NPR.  All rights reserved.

If Karian Batista had $100, she would buy food. ""I don't have enough for the kids,"" she says. Batista, 30, lives at the bottom of a hill on the outskirts of Maricao, a mountain town. Hurricane Maria tore the roof off her prefab house, and now she is living with her husband and two kids at her father-in-law's house next door. There's a plastic receptacle that looks like a giant blue trash bin on the roof for collecting rainwater. There still isn't running water or power in the area — like much of the island. Family members are barely scraping by. They live on the income from her husband's part-time job, where he works four hours a day, and the $412 they receive in monthly food assistance from the Puerto Rican government. Batista is visibly worried. She wants to move the family to New York, where her husband's father lives. ""I'm an adult. I can handle the difficult times,"" she says, holding back tears. ""But not the kids.""

 This damaged road in Maricao forces drivers to slow down almost one month after  Hurricane Maria tore through Puerto Rico. Mercy Corps, an international aid organization, has handed out emergency cash to Syrian refugees in Greece and families affected by war and violence in Mosul, Iraq. And now, it has come to do the same for survivors of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico. House by house, the group is feeling out what $100 can do for 2,800 hard-hit families across the island. ""Just a little something"" It could cost billions of dollars for Puerto Rico to recover and rebuild — so a little over $300,000 from one aid organization doesn't sound like a huge investment. But these are uncertain times. Electricity is on one day and suddenly out the next. Many people haven't had a steady paycheck in weeks or received government aid.

 Jose Sanchez Acevedo, 52, and his mother, Cruz Acevedo Soler, 74, on the front porch of the Maricao farmhouse they live in. They told Mercy Corps they would purchase rice and beans if given $100. The extra money could make a significant dent for a family of four or five. The idea is to let people decide what they need, right now, be it food, water, a tarp for the roof or diesel fuel for their generator. Cash helps give people back dignity and choice for determining their most basic needs. Jill Morehead, Mercy Corps ""Just a little something to address immediate needs,"" says Jill Morehead, the head of Mercy Corps' relief efforts on the island. ""Cash helps give people back dignity and choice for determining their most basic needs, in addition to supporting local markets and small businesses."" That's one of the main reasons cash distribution is a growing trend in disaster settings. Since 2014, Mercy Corps has implemented cash programs in 31 countries. But this is the first time the group is trying it out in Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory.

 Mercy Corps staffers Jill Morehead (left) and Alexa Swift walk up a hill in Lares as part of their field research on Puerto Rico's supply needs. Case studies have shown that cash aid is an effective way to help people in need. In crises where people have had to flee their homes, it can buy the next meal. It can also supplement incomes for people living below the poverty line. Rigorous, independent studies have shown that people generally don't spend the money on nonnecessities like tobacco or alcohol. ""It's more or less the same as welfare, which the U.S. has had for a long time,"" says Amanda Glassman, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development. ""But what makes this really interesting is that it's an NGO giving out the cash in lieu of the government."" Since Mercy Corps arrived four weeks ago, it has already distributed 290 MasterCard prepaid debit cards, in $150 to $200 increments, across the island. Funding comes from private and individual donors. Now, the group is focusing on giving out another round of money in two municipalities in the west of the island: Las Marias and Maricao. It worked with Long Term Recovery Group, a local organization that operates in this region of Puerto Rico, to identify the most vulnerable communities. Many residents are still waiting for money from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

 Homes in the Seburuquillo neighborhood of Lares remain heavily damaged nearly one month after Hurricane Maria. That includes Eugenio Beniquez, 46. Since the hurricane, no officials from FEMA or the Puerto Rican government have come to his home to offer emergency relief. The visit from Mercy Corps, he says, is the first time outsiders have come to his home. ""There's 1,000 people in this barrio,"" says Beniquez. ""We've been forgotten."" Beniquez lives with his wife, two daughters and two young grandchildren in a low-income neighborhood deep within the sunken hills of Lares. His house is at the dead end of a long and winding road. Soon after the storm, he went down to the community center in Lares to see whether he could get any help. ""One group gave me one bottle of water and the choice of one pear or one apple,"" he says. ""But not both."" He begged local officials for water, and they finally gave him some. But it was for cleaning and washing – not to drink. Beniquez's biggest problem right now is ""not the food. It's the water,"" he says. That's what he would buy if he had $100. Cash can get you only so much For the most part, the local grocery stores in Lares and San Sebastian, where people from Las Marias and Maricao shop, have some food. The meat aisle may be halved, but there are so many people living without power, most have been buying precooked meats like ham and canned Vienna sausages. What they don't have — but residents desperately need — is enough water and ice. People from all over western Puerto Rico shop at Mr. Special, a local supermarket on the main road in Lares. Store manager Jose Mendez says the water and ice shipments have been arriving irregularly — sometimes not even the full amount. When he puts out the goods, they run out in about a half-hour. A line forms, and customers are allowed to buy one bottle of water and one bag of ice per person. Mendez has another problem: Mr. Special can only take cash payments at the moment. Because the storm has disrupted telecommunications, Mendez can't get the computers at the cash registers online.

 Shoppers find empty frozen meat shelves in a Mr. Special Supermarket in Lares. It also means people can't use their tarjeta de la familia, or family card. It's a monthly stipend of money that the Puerto Rican government gives low-income families to purchase groceries. And on this part of the island, thousands of families depend on it. A family of two gets about $200 a month; a family of four, about $400. When he is not able to use his card, Beniquez says, he leaves his shopping cart right where it is — even though it's full of groceries — and walks straight out the door. It pains him to have to return to his family empty-handed. For Morehead, a trip to Mr. Special validates what she has seen and heard in her surveys. Because of the problems with the registers in Lares and San Sebastian, Mercy Corps will have to give this round of money to people in actual cash. The group previously distributed MasterCards, but the supermarkets in those areas had more reliable payment systems. Morehead also saw that people continued to have difficulty accessing clean drinking water. The shelves at Walgreens, Mr. Special and Econo, another local supermarket chain in Lares, were empty. When there is water, it is expensive — about $1.25 a bottle. The shortage of water has made people desperate. On the outskirts of Maricao, people are siphoning water dripping from a main that has been damaged by severe mudslides after the storm. They told Morehead that they were just using it for cleaning and cooking. But she suspects some are drinking it, too. She doubts it's safe to drink. Mercy Corps has added water filters to its upcoming aid delivery. It will also provide solar lanterns with USB ports. Many people have been using their cars to charge up their cellphones, then driving 30 minutes out of town to find a signal. The group hopes to deliver the aid package at the end of the month. But if workers make it back to Beniquez's home, it will be too late. He and his family are leaving Puerto Rico next week, driven by something Beniquez saw and said he will never forget.

npr,"October 24, 2017","Why You Shouldn't Count On The Promised $4,000 'Raise' From GOP Tax Plan"," This week, Sarah Huckabee Sanders promoted one of the White House's chief selling points about the Republican tax plan. The pitch: American households will get an additional $4,000 as a result of the tax overhaul proposed in September. What would your family do w/ a $4,000 raise from the President’s tax cut plan? REPLY &amp; I’ll share your family’s story in the press briefing The number comes from an estimate produced by the Council of Economic Advisers earlier this month. And while it's impossible to do a flat-out true-or-false fact check on an estimate, this figure is likely to be repeated as the White House pushes tax overhaul, and there is reason to doubt that your household will get $4,000 — or even anything close to it. What the White House claims To be clear, this isn't the White House claiming that the average household would get a $4,000 tax cut as a result of the tax plan altogether. Indeed, depending on a variety of things that are still not laid out — how brackets are shifted around, which deductions will be eliminated, a change in the standard deduction — a new tax package could affect different people in wildly different ways. Rather, the White House is claiming that one part of the tax plan — the proposed corporate tax cut, from 35 to 20 percent — would trickle down to workers, as businesses bumped wages as a result of having smaller tax bills and also deciding to bring profits into the U.S. from overseas. The Council of Economic Advisers made this argument in a recent, controversial report posted on the White House website. In fact, that paper claims $4,000 is on the low end of its estimates. On the upper end, the average household could expect to get $9,000 back. The White House's method of getting to these numbers was simple — the CEA looked at estimates of how much corporate tax rates affect workers' wages, chose two estimates (one low and one high), and applied those to a 15-point corporate tax cut. Plugging in those numbers, along with average household income (around $83,000 in 2016), the White House found that the tax cut would boost that average household's income by around $4,000 to $9,000. But some economists say that math rests upon a shaky foundation. An economist fight ensues Already, with the word ""average,"" there's reason for a taxpayer to doubt that she would receive $4,000 from this change in tax policy. After all, extremes make averages — the CEA report, for example, estimated the median household could get $3,000. But the debate over this $4,000 figure goes much deeper than that. Well-regarded top economists — including some from the left (former President Barack Obama's Treasury Secretary Larry Summers and his CEA Chairman Jason Furman) and right (Harvard economist Greg Mankiw) soon piled on with their respective critiques and defenses of the CEA's report. One big sticking point in this debate is those figures that the CEA used in its math to get the $4,000 to $9,000 range. Economist Mihir Desai, whose work informed that math, tweeted that the CEA report ""misinterprets"" his results and therefore came up with estimates that are unrealistic. The CEA paper has also sparked fierce arguments over what share of the corporate tax burden workers bear. For one thing, the White House paper cited a variety of estimates for this, but it left out some that show labor's burden to be relatively small. For example, it cited a 2006 Congressional Budget Office report that said workers shoulder 70 percent of the corporate tax burden, but it did not cite a 2012 CBO report that said the figure was 25 percent. Another paper the CEA did not cite was a report from the Obama-era Treasury Department that said workers end up paying 18 percent of corporate taxes. As the Wall Street Journal's Richard Rubin reported in September, that paper recently disappeared from the Treasury website (however, another document saying that labor bears only 19 percent of the corporate tax burden still lives on the Treasury's site). And a September Congressional Research Service report criticized several of the papers that the CEA cites to support its conclusions (including Desai's). All of which is to say that there are many reasons for American taxpayers not to expect $4,000 from this tax overhaul package (and that's if it passes). Yes, it's reasonable to imagine that a big cut in corporate taxes could lead to some sort of bump in wages. But the economics of exactly how corporate tax rates affect workers simply isn't settled, to put it mildly. So is the White House's $4,000 figure plausible? ""No, it's not. It's way too high,"" said Joe Rosenberg, senior research associate at the Tax Policy Center, a D.C. tax policy think tank that has been critical of the Trump tax plan. Even some on the right believe the White House is overshooting with its estimate. ""This estimate is considerably higher than I would expect,"" wrote Michael Strain, director of economic policy studies at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute, for Bloomberg this week. ""We don't know the exact magnitude. Is it going to be $400 or $500, or is it going to be $4,000 to $9,000?"" is how Aparna Mathur, resident scholar in economic studies at AEI, put it. She has co-authored papers with CEA Chairman Kevin Hassett about the relationship between corporate taxes and wages. She adds, ""It does sound pretty high."" Mathur says the CEA's math was done correctly but that there is a problem in believing that math would work perfectly in the real world. ""The way I read it is, yeah, it takes an estimate from the literature, it applies the numbers directly and says it's likely you could get a $4,000 wage increase, but it has to be conditioned on everything else going so smoothly,"" she says. For its part, the White House defends its estimates. ""The analysis that produced this estimate follows the standards of the economics profession,"" a spokesperson wrote in an email. ""CEA remains happy to debate any methodological assumption, which some of the criticisms of the CEA study — including some that have been prominently covered in the media — have not done."" No policy happens in a vacuum One problem with the estimates, in Mathur's mind, is that a corporate tax cut wouldn't happen in a vacuum. Rather, it would come alongside other potential effects from the tax plan — a big deficit hike, for example. Congress just cleared the way for a new tax plan to add $1.5 trillion to the deficit. ""You're not going to allow fiscal deficits to continue indefinitely,"" she says. ""So then projecting these scenarios of $4,000, that starts sounding implausible."" Lawmakers might, for example, decide to raise taxes again in the future to try to close a fiscal hole. Or it's possible that a growing debt could eventually cause interest rates to rise, slowing the economy. Not only that, but it's not clear what else lawmakers might do to corporate taxes besides lowering the rates. They may also broaden the base, deciding to cut out businesses' deductions and credits to offset at least some of the lost revenue from a corporate tax rate cut. And that could mean offsetting some of the wage gains that might result from a corporate tax cut. Criticisms from the left, meanwhile, have taken aim not so much at the deficit-ballooning aspect of the tax plan as at the trickle-down economics behind it. Economist Stephanie Kelton, who advised the 2016 Bernie Sanders campaign, pointed out that ""sending a $4,000 check to every household in America raises average household incomes by $4,000."" Jacob Leibenluft, who worked for the Obama administration and currently is a senior adviser at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, likewise criticized the White House for trying to sell the benefits of a corporate tax cut to the middle class, instead of plotting out a middle-class tax cut. It's possible that that plan will cut the middle class's tax burden. In a recent estimate of the tax plan's effects, the Tax Policy Center found that it would help the middle class (but help higher earners far, far more). However, the tax plan as presented thus far has many holes in it — for example, it didn't specify what the income cutoff points would be for the new tax brackets. In addition, it left some promises of middle-class tax relief (""additional measures to meaningfully reduce the tax burden on the middle-class"") decidedly fuzzy. The assumptions that the Tax Policy Center made to fill in some of those holes led the administration to sharply rebuke the think tank. So when the administration came out with its own, assumption-based math, Rosenberg was surprised. ""It was strange to hear them to come out with such a specific estimate of what it would do to people's wages after saying it was completely implausible to think anybody could know anything about the effects of their plan,"" he says.

npr,"October 24, 2017","Congress Works On Tax Overhaul, Trump Says 401(k) Breaks Won't Change"," Quote, ""there will be no change to your 401k."" For more on this, we turn, as we often do, to David Wessel. He directs the Hutchins Center at the Brookings Institution and is a contributing correspondent for The Wall Street Journal. David, good morning. DAVID WESSEL: Good morning. INSKEEP: Would you remind us how a 401k works and how that would change if this idea ever became law? WESSEL: Sure. The tax law currently says that workers can take a tax deduction if they make a contribution to one of these retirement plans of up to $18,000 a year or $24,000 a year if you're over 50. The money is taxed only when it comes out in retirement. INSKEEP: Oh, so that way, you can, like, you can grow the money tax free. And it's taxed at the end, OK. WESSEL: Exactly. Now, the Republicans were considering lowering that $18,000 cap to $2,400. But there was a twist. Any additional contributions would go into what's called a Roth-style retirement account, named for a former senator. That means no upfront tax deduction. But you don't have to pay taxes when you take the money out in retirement. It turns out that's really unpopular with people who take advantage of this deduction and really unpopular with the money management industry that manages this money. Now, the president, as you said, seems to have killed this off. He tweeted, quote, ""this has always been a great and popular middle-class tax break that works and it stays,"" exclamation point. INSKEEP: Well, why were Republicans thinking about this at all? WESSEL: Well, look, Republicans are struggling to keep the size of their tax cut to $1.5 trillion over 10 years, and they have a $4 trillion wish list. So something has to give. This particular proposal had what is a gimmick of sorts 'cause it would have raised about $100 million in the near term because people were taking fewer tax deductions. But it would have lowered revenue far in the future when the money came out of retirement accounts. INSKEEP: So it would get the benefit, so to speak, now, for the deficit anyway, and cause some problems later. WESSEL: Exactly. INSKEEP: So this goes away. The president wants this to be seen as a middle-class tax break, this plan on the whole. Is that true? Is that accurate? WESSEL: Well, certainly a lot of self-described middle-class people take advantage of it, that's for sure. But the fact is that upper-income tax payers get a lot more benefit from all these tax breaks that lower income tax. INSKEEP: Oh, because they have more money to put in. WESSEL: Well, first of all, yes, but also the higher your tax bracket, the more you save from any deduction. But, yes, upper-income people are the ones who have enough money left over after they pay their bills to put $18,000 in a retirement account. Most people don't do that. A couple of Census Bureau researchers, Michael Gideon and Josh Mitchell are their names, recently figured that only about a third of all workers save in these accounts at all. The rest either aren't offered them at work or if they're offered, they don't participate. INSKEEP: So are they actually encouraging retirement savings at a time when we're worried that millions of Americans aren't saving enough for retirement? WESSEL: OK, that's a good question. Now, there's a lot of academic debate on that. The question really is whether a lot of people, particularly well-off folks, are getting a tax break for saving they would have done otherwise. There's one study by an economist named Raj Chetty at Stanford who found that only about 15 percent of the workers respond to the size of the tax break for retirement. The rest, 85 percent, simply put in their account whatever the contribution is that their employer tells them that they put it in. So it doesn't make any difference. INSKEEP: You know, all this discussion is reminding me of a forecast that I've seen in recent weeks that Republicans might end up just cutting tax rates, letting the deficit go up and forgetting about all this eliminating deductions to pay for it. WESSEL: I think that's highly likely. It's a lot easier to cut tax rates, run up the budget deficit, than it is to offset the lost revenue by getting rid of somebody's tax break, especially one that's popular. The constraint is, though, the Senate budget resolution says no more than $1.5 trillion over 10 years. So either they're going to have less of a tax cut or they're going to have to get rid of some popular deductions. INSKEEP: David, always a pleasure talking with you. WESSEL: You're welcome. INSKEEP: That's David Wessel of the Hutchins Center at the Brookings Institution. Copyright © 2017 NPR.  All rights reserved.

npr,"October 23, 2017",How The Affordable Housing Crisis Is Playing Out In One Dallas Neighborhood," We're about to meet a man who some say is a champion for the poor. Others say he's a slumlord. And that split says a lot about the country's affordable housing crisis. There are fewer places where people can afford to live. Rents are soaring, but the conditions of rentals are not improving. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:  There are government programs to help - for example, Section 8 vouchers. But those programs only reach a quarter of the people who need help. The rest wind up in the country's poorest neighborhoods where the issue of how to provide adequate housing is fought over by cities, landlords and tenants. SHAPIRO: NPR's Laura Sullivan partnered with PBS's ""FRONTLINE"" and their new podcast The FRONTLINE Dispatch and followed this crisis as it unfolded in one Dallas neighborhood. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: HMK - how can I help you? LAURA SULLIVAN, BYLINE: There are two ways to describe the man called Khraish Khraish in West Dallas. He's either a landlord saving the poor from homelessness, or he's one of the city's worst slumlords. KHRAISH KHRAISH: Hi. SULLIVAN: Hey, Khraish. KHRAISH: So sorry I'm late. SULLIVAN: No problem. KHRAISH: Come on in. SULLIVAN: Khraish works out of a small West Dallas office where he manages about 300 homes he and his dad own in the neighborhood. They're mostly crumbling 1940s one-story wooden houses, but at 400 or 500 a month, they're some of the cheapest in the city. KHRAISH: Twelve-hour days, six days a week. We're still open six days a week. SULLIVAN: They've made a good business out of it, but Khraish isn't flashy. He drives a 10-year-old car and lives in a middle-class neighborhood. He says he feels a kinship with many of his renters, who, like his parents, are immigrants. They came from Lebanon. KHRAISH: I learned a tremendous amount from my dad, primarily a work ethic. He didn't give me advice about girls. It was work hard. Study hard. And your word is everything you have. SULLIVAN: Which made what happened last fall confusing. KHRAISH: I remember one evening sitting with my wife. And you know, I'd just come home from work. And we were watching the 6 o'clock news. And the broadcaster literally opened up the newscast saying - like this. He goes, they call him the most unpopular man in the city of Dallas. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOHN MCCAA: Well, he could be the most unpopular man in the city tonight. The... KHRAISH: And I looked at my wife. I said, they're talking about me. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BRETT SHIPP: The owner, Khraish H. Khraish, in the past few days... KHRAISH: And it was just this horrible story about me and the business. I've been proud of what I've done in providing housing to the lowest-income households in Dallas, and now I was getting this smear campaign about what a horrible person I was. (SOUNDBITE OF TRAIN HORN) SULLIVAN: West Dallas has had it rough for half a century. It's been home to a lead smelter yard, an EPA Superfund site, and much poverty. But five years ago, the city built a bridge - the Margaret Hunt Hill Bridge - connecting West Dallas directly into the city center. And now the place seems to be booming. (SOUNDBITE OF BACK-UP BEEPER) SULLIVAN: Look at all this construction. NPR producer Meg Anderson and I recently drove past huge new apartment complexes as we went to find one of Khraish's most dependable tenants, 81-year-old Pearlie Mae Brown. MEG ANDERSON, BYLINE: Here, found it. SULLIVAN: The siding of Brown's house is popping out, and the whole place seems to be listing. Inside, cardboard is hiding a huge hole down to the dirt below the house. What kind of a floor is this? PEARLIE MAE BROWN: It's supposed to be a wooden floor. SULLIVAN: Many of the outlets don't work, and cockroaches run across the floor. Still, Pearlie Mae Brown's house is constantly bustling. (SOUNDBITE OF TELEPHONE RINGING) BROWN: There it go again. SULLIVAN: Neighbors stop by. So does her daughter. Pearline Brown Harper wastes no time when I ask her about Khraish. PEARLINE BROWN HARPER: (Laughter) It shouldn't come out of anybody's mouth what I think about him. SULLIVAN: Really? HARPER: Yeah. He didn't come fix nothing. He just told the tenants that they would have to take care of stuff theirselves. He's just a slumlord. And these people out here have made him the, you know, rich man that he is. SULLIVAN: Harper is right about at least one thing. The homes have brought in a lot of money. With 300 homes at 400 or 500 a month, Khraish could be collecting as much as $150,000 a month in rent. But Khraish isn't the only one to see the investment potential here. Across the country, mom-and-pop landlords are on the decline, and studies show owners with dozens or hundreds of properties are on the rise. The less a landlord has to spend on repairs, the more money he or she stands to make. In Brown's house, a neighbor pops in to see what's going on. Hi there. BENNIE KILSON: Hello. How you doing? SULLIVAN: Bennie Kilson is 71. She says her house is in bad shape, too. She does all the repairs herself. And right now, leaning against Pearlie Mae's broken screen door, she's about to put her finger on the root of the entire problem. KILSON: OK, my husband died back there in 2008. My husband didn't have no whole lot of Social Security. SULLIVAN: Yeah. KILSON: What I get now is $632. Now, where in the world can I move with that? You can't. SULLIVAN: And she's right not just in West Dallas but in cities all across the country. Median rent has increased 70 percent over the past two decades while housing conditions haven't improved. And according to government data, the majority of poor families are spending more than half of their already small incomes just to cover rent. In Dallas two years ago, the city decided it was going to get serious about living conditions in West Dallas. Assistant City Attorney Melissa Miles and others went into dozens of Khraish's homes. MELISSA MILES: Houses falling off their foundations - I mean, literally - walls that don't connect anymore, rooms where you look through in the seams of the walls. You could see light from the outside. SULLIVAN: They sent Khraish a binder with hundreds of citations. He said it was devastating. KHRAISH: It was just bankruptcy. And they want me to bring them to a standard that these houses cannot attain. It's like, how do you make a 1930s engine meet modern-day emission standards? You cannot. SULLIVAN: But from the city's standpoint, that was Khraish's problem. MILES: I don't have a ton of sympathy for someone who got away with something to their benefit, to the detriment of other people who weren't in a good negotiating position. SULLIVAN: But the bigger question looming over all of this is not why the city intervened but why they intervened now. And Khraish had a theory. KHRAISH: The city of Dallas does not want low-income households in the city. SULLIVAN: Khraish's theory goes like this. The city wants him to renovate his homes because if he renovates, he'll have to charge more to recoup the costs. His tenants can't pay more, so they'll go live somewhere else, somewhere other than revitalized West Dallas or maybe all of Dallas. KHRAISH: Their affordable housing policy is not to have one. SULLIVAN: So we went to city hall to ask the mayor if that was true. Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings said, of course not. MIKE RAWLINGS: I think you have to make those decisions based on principles. And that is the principles of making sure that people live in safe environments, OK? Safe and clean environments is not asking too much. SULLIVAN: It took the city decades to ask that much. But Rawlings says he hopes poor people, middle-class people and wealthy people will all live together in the new West Dallas. RAWLINGS: We're going to have people live in good housing, and we're going to keep pushing this thing. So we're going to find better and better answers. SULLIVAN: But the answer Khraish came up with was not what anyone was expecting. Last spring, he decided he wasn't going to renovate his homes. Instead, he said he was going to tear them down and evict the tenants. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MARIE SAAVEDRA: The largest junk property landlord in the city is threatening to evict most of his tenants. SULLIVAN: Suddenly Pearlie Mae Brown and Bennie Kilson and hundreds of others were facing homelessness. KHRAISH: When I shut down my rental business and 300 households were facing imminent displacement, you know what the real panic was? It wasn't that they had to leave. It's that there was no place to go to. There was not 300 units in the city of Dallas - affordable housing units in the entire city of Dallas. SULLIVAN: Melissa Miles could only throw up her hands in frustration. She and the city wanted people in better conditions, not homeless. MILES: I understand there's blame to go around. There's blame for the city. I think there's blame right up the ladder of government and sort of everyone in between, from national policy to the owner of a particular property not caring enough, not being humane enough, not being willing to be a little less personally greedy to do something about it. SULLIVAN: So what is a city to do, enforce code, force landlords to pay for repairs and proper upkeep so that people live in decent conditions but know that rents could go up and the poor may have no place to live, or let the properties go and face a reality that in 2017, in the wealthiest country in the world, some of its most vulnerable residents live in squalor? Now, cities could avoid this choice by never letting properties go into disrepair in the first place. But that costs money. You have to take landlords to court, staff an office, stay on it. Meg and I took a walk around the broken sidewalks and chain-link fences of West Dallas with prominent housing civil rights lawyer Michael Daniel. MICHAEL DANIEL: You look at downtown. There's a lot of tax money that comes in from downtown. It wouldn't take a lot of it to make some differences. But you can't shift it... SULLIVAN: You can't. You can't take money from downtown. DANIEL: ...'Cause it's already set for every place else. And if you start telling people, your potholes are going to last a year longer because we're going to do code enforcement in West Dallas, their council members will say, I'll lose; I can't do that. SULLIVAN: As he said this, we stopped in front of a lot where Khraish had already demolished the house that was on it. I told him city officials said they were stunned he was tearing houses down. DANIEL: They weren't stunned. [Expletive]-damn the city. SULLIVAN: Yeah. DANIEL: (Laughter) No, that's not being stunned. Those are crocodile tears at best 'cause the city will do it if the landlords don't. SULLIVAN: You're saying the city looks at this and is secretly happy. DANIEL: Yeah. And the fact is the landlords paid the money. And the city didn't have to spend the money. I mean, it's the solution. SULLIVAN: It's the solution that goes to their endgame. DANIEL: Yes. SULLIVAN: Which is what? DANIEL: You bring it all down, and you bring it back as something that rises from the ashes. SULLIVAN: Except in those ashes, he says, only wealthy people get to live, and you don't even need to do code enforcement. And that could have been the end of the story, except Khraish had one more coda to add. A few months ago, he announced he was sparing half his tenants from eviction. Instead, he says, he's making them homeowners. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: Some West Dallas tenants on the brink of eviction are getting the chance at homeownership. SULLIVAN: He's going to loan the tenants the money to buy the houses from him. Seller-financed deals are often controversial and can sometimes leave buyers with less-than-favorable terms. For example, Khraish's contract says if buyers miss one payment, he can demand that they pay off the entire house immediately or lose it. Whether or not that happens, Khraish will collect payments but will no longer have to worry about repairs. Pearlie Mae Brown signed a similar contract with Khraish. She can't afford to fix the house, but she told us she has no choice. She has nowhere to go. When we asked Mayor Mike Rawlings about this, he said it was a happy ending. More than a hundred people will get to stay in West Dallas. RAWLINGS: It's not my job to lawyer to the papers, OK? And I don't think that he's got any motivation to outright defraud individuals. SULLIVAN: So we asked him, does he? KHRAISH: I was never a slumlord, but I'm certainly not going to trade the slumlord moniker for the predatory lender moniker. I'm trying to do the right thing. I believe I am doing the right thing. I believe that the community trusts me that I'm doing the right thing. SULLIVAN: And that's where we've landed. Millions of Americans are living in poverty without any government help. The future of these residents, at least, comes down to trust, trust that this landlord will do what's in the best interests of his tenants. With Meg Anderson, I'm Laura Sullivan, NPR News.

npr,"October 23, 2017",Trump Mulls Reappointing Janet Yellen To Another Term As Fed Chair," David, good morning. DAVID WESSEL: Good morning. INSKEEP: So is Janet Yellen Donald Trump's kind of Fed chair? WESSEL: Well, we'll find out. On one hand, the president seems to favor someone who won't raise interest rates rapidly, who won't be spooked by a low unemployment rate. And Janet Yellen seems to fit that bill. On the other hand, he and his advisers have made clear that they want to roll back some of the financial regulations imposed after the crisis, and she seems very unsympathetic to that. INSKEEP: Well, let's talk about that because the Fed chair, in modern days, does talk in public from time to time, give public testimony, press conferences. Hasn't she commented on some issues of great interest to the president? WESSEL: Well, yes. She - in a speech at the Fed's Jackson Hole conference in August, she made clear that she was going to resist rolling back the regulations that followed the crisis - the Dodd-Frank Act and so forth. But I would think that the president would care a lot more about what she does to interest rates. And on that score, he hasn't had any complaints. INSKEEP: Because interest rates have remained extraordinarily low. We should mention, this is a big deal for every president, even though every president, I'm sure, would deny that he considers it. What is going to be the interest rate over the next two, or three or four years would make a big difference to the president's re-election. That's going to be true with this president, as it is with any. WESSEL: That's right. And of course, interest rates decisions are made by a committee, not by the Fed chair herself or himself. But the Fed has evolved. It's more democratic than it used to be. Alan Greenspan and Paul Volcker ruled the roost like an autocrat. Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen have not. So one consideration for the president is picking someone who can hold the committee together and not cause a lot of instability or divisiveness. INSKEEP: So if it's not Yellen, who else is there? WESSEL: There are two candidates, known as the disrupters, who've been critical of the Bernanke-Yellen Fed - Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor, popular with some Republicans, sympathetic to President Trump's efforts to cut taxes to spur growth, and John Taylor, the only Ph.D. economist besides Janet Yellen on the president's list. He's at Stanford. He came up with a rule for setting interest rates. Unfortunately, for him, it would suggest that interest rates should be a lot higher than they are now. And then there's the continuity alternative to Janet Yellen, Jay Powell, a Republican member of the Federal Reserve Board now, who would probably follow her policy of gradual, gentle interest rate increases but is a little bit more sympathetic to the financial regulation positions of the administration. INSKEEP: Could the choice of the next Fed chair significantly affect the way that the United States tries to manage the next recession? WESSEL: Absolutely. One of the challenges that the next Fed chair faces is how to handle a recession when interest rates are still low, and they won't be able to cut them by 4 or 5 percentage points the way the Fed has in the past. So this is one of the challenges. And it's a thing that argues for having kind of a seasoned economist to manage this. If the Fed chair gets it wrong, not only will the economy of the U.S. suffer, but the world and the financial markets will suffer as well. INSKEEP: David Wessel, who writes for The Wall Street Journal and is at the Hutchins Center of the Brookings Institution. David, thanks. WESSEL: You're welcome.

npr,"October 21, 2017","Don't Surrender, Reinvent: The New Mantra Of Small Biz In Puerto Rico"," Just seven months ago, Puerto Rican chef Jose Sanchez opened the restaurant of his dreams: a place where you could feel like you were in Italy one day, and like you were in France the next.  He served up fusion cuisine and called it Pera Maraya. There was deconstructed ratatouille, caprese salad with octopus. The restaurant in Carolina, east of San Juan, was getting rave reviews: five stars on Yelp, Trip Advisor and Facebook. He spent nearly a decade saving up to open this restaurant, and was overjoyed at how quickly it found success. ""Everything was going perfect,"" says Sanchez, 28. ""Then the storm hit."" Hurricane Maria, which blew through Puerto Rico four weeks ago, nearly destroyed his property. The damage was heavy, though still fixable. But he wasn't prepared for what followed: across the island, there was almost no electricity, no running water, no telecommunications. He laid off his six-person staff and closed up shop.

 Electrical wires are exposed inside the restaurant. Small businesses like Sanchez's were the backbone of Puerto Rico's economy. They employed more than 80 percent of all private sector workers in Puerto Rico, according to a 2016 survey from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  But the big question now is how the economy will possibly recover. Small shops face a mountain of challenges: can they receive emergency aid? Can they repair their storefronts? Will customers ever return? That all depends on whether owners can se levanta — get up — says Alessandra Correa, a local business leader in San Juan. It's a phrase that's been repeated over and over again by Puerto Ricans since the storm hit. ""We have to fight,"" she says. ""Fight for our businesses, for our employees and our economy. Giving up is not an option."" That's why today Sanchez is slinging Styrofoam containers of fried steak and eggs for workers at Correa's office in San Juan. It's a far cry from the six-course tasting menu he whipped up at his restaurant. He's hoping to raise $5,000 to buy a food truck so he can start over. It was an idea suggested by Correa, who had been a regular at Pera Maraya. She called him up after she saw the restaurant shuttered as she passed by one day. ""Where are you?"" she asked Sanchez. He was just sitting at home. ""You can cook. You're still alive, right?"" She invited him to set the pop-up lunch at her office. ""Go ahead,"" she says. ""Come sell your food here."" Correa is the founder of Inprende, a startup that helps entrepreneurs get off the ground. Since the storm forced many small businesses to close, her office has been buzzing with owners who've come to seek help on how to get back up and running. It's advice she usually charges for — but is now giving away for free to anyone who needs it. The place has a hip Silicon Valley feel: a ping pong table, a bright blue shag rug and copies of Harvard Business Review in the waiting area.  
                Before the hurricane, Sanchez tried to cover up the walls with plywood. It helped salvage the ironwork and glass doors but he has no idea where his patio fence went.

 Before the hurricane, Sanchez tried to cover up the walls with plywood. It helped salvage the ironwork and glass doors but he has no idea where his patio fence went. While Sanchez was using Correa's space to host his pop-up lunch, others were using it for WiFi and power from a generator. At one end of the ping pong table was Emmanuel Oquendo, the 24-year-old founder of BrainHi, an app that helps patients book doctors' appointments through Facebook.  He considers Correa a ""personal mentor."" When a big potential client pulled out of buying his product after the hurricane, Correa advised him to dig deep and find the opportunity in Maria. He realized that the lack of cell phone service on the island could make his app more appealing. People still needed to go to the doctor's, but they couldn't call and make appointments. They did, however, have access to some WiFi, which meant access to Facebook.  But local business leaders like Correa can only help their peers so much. In times of crisis, the government should be doing even more to provide support and resources to small businesses, says Arnaldo Cruz, director of research and analytics for Foundation for Puerto Rico, a nonprofit that promotes economic development on the island. The stakes are high. If the island's small businesses fail, that could mean massive layoffs and unemployment on top of an already disastrous economic situation: billions of dollars in hurricane recovery efforts on top of the island's pre-existing $74 billion debt crisis. On Tuesday, the Department of Economic Development and Commerce (DEDC) of Puerto Rico hosted a workshop for businesses on how to apply for low-interest loans from the Small Business Administration and the Puerto Rico Economic Development Bank. Mostly, how to fill out its very complicated forms.

 Sanchez looks at two air conditioners that blew off the back of the roof. It's all the help that the government can offer at the moment, says Manuel Laboy, the secretary of the DEDC. ""Puerto Rico doesn't have the resources to inject money into the economy. We don't have that cash."" Cruz, who did not attend the meeting, heard from others in the business community that the meeting was not very helpful. To apply for a loan with the Small Business Administration, for example, businesses would need to gather their paperwork. Find a computer and WiFi to fill out forms. Then the office has to evaluate the application. In some cases, that could take up to six to nine months. ""Small businesses don't have time,"" says Cruz. ""They're gonna run out of business in the next couple of weeks."" That's why his organization is trying to figure out ways to disburse money right now. They're distributing up to $5,000 in cash grants to 50 small businesses that show the most promise of making a profit. Restaurants that just need enough money to cover one or two payrolls are good investments – they're likely to survive after Maria. A gift shop geared to tourists in front of a hotel that just shut down, not so much. The underlying message of the aid: ""Just don't close. Don't surrender,"" says Cruz. For Sanchez, the restaurant is gone for now. But it doesn't mean that he surrendered. After hosting four or five pop-up lunches at Inprende, he almost has the $5,000 he needs for the food truck. He knows things can't go back to the way they were before. Since Maria, many of his customers have moved out of Puerto Rico or don't have the means to pay for a $31 plate of lobster in Manchego cheese sauce. If he ever reopens the restaurant, he's thinking maybe he'll cook high quality comfort foods at a lower cost, like the steak and eggs. He reminds himself what Correa, the entrepreneur, told him: He may have lost everything. But he can still cook. NPR thanks our sponsors Become an NPR sponsor ",http://www.npr.org/559047858
npr,"October 19, 2017",The 30th Anniversary Of Black Monday: A Day That Made Wall Street Quake," Hysteria. Panic. Those were words reporters were using on this day 30 years ago to describe the stock market crash, now remembered as Black Monday. Oct. 19, 1987, brought the single biggest one-day percentage drop in history — and yes, that includes the 1929 crash that presaged the coming of the Great Depression. On that frightening Monday three decades ago, the Dow Jones industrial average plunged 508 points — more than 22 percent — to just over 1,700. Since then, the Dow has more than bounced back. In fact, this week it set another record, surpassing the 23,000 milestone. If the Dow were to repeat the 1987 plunge, it would have to lose more than 5,000 points in a day. ""People were coming out for their smoking breaks and they looked shellshocked,"" NPR's former economic correspondent Barbara Mantel reported from outside the New York Stock Exchange on Black Monday. ""They were using words like hysteria, panic to describe what was going on inside."" But markets didn't disintegrate. They pulled themselves together and recovered. 
                ""People remembered Black Monday as a meaningless event, when in fact, it was probably the most revelatory of our crashes,"" says author Diana B. Henriques.

 ""People remembered Black Monday as a meaningless event, when in fact, it was probably the most revelatory of our crashes,"" says author Diana B. Henriques. ""It wasn't like any previous market crash and yet, every crash since has been similar to '87,"" says Diana B. Henriques, author of a new book, A First-Class Catastrophe: The Road to Black Monday, the Worst Day in Wall Street History.  ""Not only was Black Monday worse than we remember today; it was worse than we knew at the time,"" she says. ""Some events are important because of what they reveal, what they show us about the world we're living in. And that was what made the 1987 crash so important."" 30 Years After 'Black Monday,' Has Wall Street Learned Its Lesson? Since Black Monday, the country has seen other scary crashes. For example, in the financial crisis of 2008, there was the ""Lehman Monday"" that spooked markets and led to frantic government intervention. But the financial landscape has changed, with high-speed computers able to trade tens of millions of shares within minutes. In a way, Black Monday was ""like a crystal ball,"" Henriques says. By closely examining the events within it, it becomes clear that the crash has contributed to the financial world that exists now, she argues. ""You could see that giant investors, and novel derivatives, and high-speed trading using computers in a balkanized regulatory system was going to be the shape of the future,"" she says. Regulators responded to Black Monday with so-called circuit breakers — rules intended to prevent massive panic sell-offs by allowing exchanges to temporarily halt trading during exceptionally large price declines. But Henriques says there is still unfinished business from Black Monday that regulators should address. ""I think we need to get serious about trying to build a regulatory system that matches the market we're living in, not the one we left behind,"" she says.

npr,"October 17, 2017",Efforts To Rewrite NAFTA Not Going Well; Next Round of Talks Delayed," When negotiators for the United States, Canada and Mexico wrapped up the latest round of trade talks in Washington on Tuesday, they sounded frustrated — and far apart. From cars to cows, they have big disagreements over how the North American Free Trade Agreement should work. In fact, the disputes appear so big, they may be threatening the future of NAFTA. So officials have agreed to delay their next meeting — pushing off its start in Mexico City until Nov. 17; they originally had planned to meet later this month. President Trump's top trade official, Robert Lighthizer, appeared at a dour press conference at the end of the week-long talks, standing along side his counterparts from Canada and Mexico. He said the terms of the pact must change because ""it must be fair."" But Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said the United States is trying to ""turn back the clock"" on trade relations with a ""winner-takes-all"" approach. She called U.S. demands ""troubling."" The U.S. backs a proposal that would allow NAFTA to expire every five years unless all three countries agree to renew it. Canadian and Mexican officials, along with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, say such a ""sunset"" provision would create tremendous uncertainty and discourage investment. The U.S. also wants to change the rules determining how autos are traded among the three countries. Other disputes center on dairy products. NAFTA has shaped commerce on this continent for nearly a quarter century. But Trump has called it ""the worst deal ever."" So earlier this year, his administration initiated this series of talks to reshape the pact to make it more favorable to the United States. But Mexican and Canadian officials say the proposed changes reflect ""America first"" language that would make it harder for companies to move goods — such as auto parts — around the trade bloc. ""Proposed new U.S. national content requirements would severely disrupt these supply chains,"" Freeland said. Freeland said she hopes that when officials next meet, they will bring a ""fresh, creative perspective."" And Mexico's economy minister, Ildefonso Guajardo, said: ""None of us wants to leave this process empty-handed.""

Now President Obama is proposing new legislation aimed at helping companies deal with suits brought by ""patent assertion entities,"" aka patent trolls — companies that the president says ""don't actually produce anything themselves,"" and instead exist ""to essentially leverage and hijack somebody else's idea and see if they can extort some money out of them.""

 The red part of the bars shows patent lawsuits brought by patent assertion Entities (PAEs, also known as ""patent trolls""). One of the proposals put forward by Obama aims to tackle a problem Carbonite faced in fighting its patent suit — finding the real owner of a patent. The president's proposal calls for requiring ""patent applicants and owners to regularly update ownership information when they are involved in proceedings before the PTO, specifically designating the 'ultimate parent entity' in control of the patent or application."" In Carbonite's case, the patents the company was accused of violating were registered to a man named Chris Crawford, but controlled by a company called Oasis Research. Oasis Research never returned any of our many phone calls. When we visited the address listed as its office, in the middle of a workday, we found what seemed to be a locked, empty office. Carbonite eventually learned that 90 percent of Oasis Research's net profit was going to another company, Intellectual Ventures, owned by former Microsoft chief technology officer Nathan Myhrvold. Intellectual Ventures was then paying Crawford 17 1/2 percent of the money it earned from his patents. Intellectual Ventures has been accused of being a patent troll by influential members of the tech press. Obama also proposed sanctioning ""abusive court filings"" by giving judges the ability to require some companies who sue for patent infringement to pay the legal fees of the company they have sued. In addition, the Obama administration wants to tackle a problem we presented in our recent episode about patent litigation in the podcast world. In that show we talked about litigation involving end-users, people who use products containing patented technology. A company claiming to have the patent on podcasting is sending threatening letters to podcasters like Marc Maron and Adam Carolla. Obama has proposed protecting ""off-the-shelf use by consumers and businesses by providing them with better legal protection against liability for a product being used off-the-shelf and solely for its intended use.""

npr,"June 4, 2013",When Patents Attack ... Part Two!," When we tried to contact Crawford, he didn't return any phone calls. He didn't return emails. His patents are now in the hands of a company called Oasis Research, and the patents were being used to sue more than a dozen different tech businesses. Oasis Research has no researchers and no employees of any kind that we could find. Its only place of business seemed to be an empty office in a corridor of empty offices in a small town in Texas. We had a lot of questions about Chris Crawford and Oasis Research, but because of the secretive nature of these lawsuits, there were basic questions we could not answer. Now, two years later, the litigation is over, and it has given us a rare look inside this world. Here's what we've learned: Originally, there were 18 tech companies that Oasis claimed were infringing on Chris Crawford's patents. But that pool got smaller and smaller as companies decided to just cut a deal with Oasis and pay a licensing fee. At a certain point, an online backup company called Carbonite was one of just two companies remaining in the case. The other company was EMC. (Full disclosure: Carbonite is an underwriter of NPR news programs.) Carbonite CEO David Friend says it was tough to be one of the last men standing, especially when the company's lawyers kept encouraging Friend to settle. Defending a patent case is really difficult because explaining technology and patents to a jury is a big challenge, so lawyers for Carbonite and EMC pursued a second strategy as well. If they could demonstrate that the inventor wasn't telling the truth when he filled out the patent application, the patent could be invalidated. So the lawyers for Carbonite and EMC started to dig into Crawford's past looking for evidence of this. One of the first places they went looking was the company where Crawford was working at the time he claimed to have come up with his ideas. They found Crawford's old boss, Chuck Campos. Campos told them he was around when the ideas in the patents were developed, and that they weren't only Crawford's ideas. Campos told the lawyers that the ideas mainly came from two other guys, Jack Byrd and Don Atwood. Byrd and Atwood were developing software together in 1990, and they wanted to come up with a secure way to back up their work. The only way to do that at the time was to download the work to floppy disk drives, but Byrd and Atwood thought there had to be a better way. They started a company to use phone modems to back up data remotely. They hired Campos and Crawford to help them. The four men agreed to split ownership four ways, and Byrd named the new company PC Oasis. The ""oasis"" part of that name was an acronym — short for Offsite Archival Software and Information Server. They met on Saturdays to discuss setting up the business, but they couldn't figure out a way to get it up and running using the technology available in the early '90s — phone lines and modems. So, they disbanded the company and went their separate ways. It was the end of Oasis for Bryd, Atwood and Campos, but not for Crawford. Crawford had kept detailed notes of those Saturday meetings, and a couple of years later, he filed patents based on those notes. Carbonite's chief counsel Danielle Sheer says Crawford then sold those patents to a company called Kwon Holdings for $12 million and a percentage of royalties that the next owner collects. Sheer says that Byrd, Atwood and Campos knew ""nothing about what Chris Crawford is doing. Nothing at all."" A decade later, those patents ended up the property of another company with Oasis in the name, Oasis Research, a company that pays Crawford a portion of the money it collects from the patents. If Crawford's three former business partners had also developed the ideas, they should have been, at the very least, listed as co-inventors on Crawford's original patent applications. This was the smoking gun the lawyers had been looking for, but they weren't sure it would be enough to convince a jury. At the trial, it would still be just the word of Byrd, Atwood and Campos against Crawford's. The lawyers wanted proof. They found it in the form of one sentence among thousands of pages that Crawford submitted to the patent office. The sentence was this: ""This proposal it is in response to Jack Byrd's idea to provide automated offsite backup services for PC users."" The lawyers for Carbonite and EMC argued that was conclusive evidence that Crawford's patents were based on Byrd's idea. At a videotaped deposition Crawford gave as part of the Oasis trial, he offered up a surprising defense. He argued that the sentence didn't actually mean the idea was Byrd's, because he, Crawford, had used the apostrophe ""s"" incorrectly. Attorney: ""I'm asking you, though — you certainly know what the use of an apostrophe 's' means, do you not?"" Chris Crawford: ""As I've written documents over the years, there are times when I use an apostrophe 's,' and it seems like I'm supposed to use an apostrophe 's.' But I have to say that my grammar is not strong enough to tell you right now with clarity when an apostrophe 's' is used."" His explanation apparently did not convince the jury, which concluded that the patents were indeed invalid for failing to name the correct co-inventors. Carbonite won, and yet its lawyers say the victory just shows how difficult it is for a company to defend itself against a patent infringement claim. The jury concluded that Byrd should have been listed as a co-inventor, but not Campos and Atwood, the other men who testified under oath that they too had been involved in developing the ideas. Only Byrd's name had been on that document, so only Byrd got credit from the jury as a co-inventor. Lawyers for Carbonite believe that if not for that document mentioning Byrd, the jury might not have invalidated Crawford's patent, and Carbonite might have ended up paying damages. For the 16 companies that did settle with Oasis, the verdict may not change anything. In most cases these licensing agreements have language that makes them nearly impossible to get out of — no matter what happens with the patent. A spokesman for one of the companies that settled sent us an email saying: ""We were hit hard by this lawsuit. Infringement on our part seemed completely bogus, but we could not afford to fight it. Even with the settlement, we were forced to lay off employees. We are STILL paying out on the settlement agreement. We were unaware that the patent had been invalidated. We will be contacting our attorney to see what recourse we may have."" It's unknown how much money Oasis received from those licensing arrangements. We do know how much it wanted from Carbonite. Danielle Sheer said Oasis proposed a $20 million license fee plus a portion of revenue going forward. Tom Ewing, an intellectual property lawyer who studies patent infringement cases, says, assuming Oasis was asking for settlements in rough proportion to the size of the company being targeted, a pretty good estimate of its total take ""might be in excess of $100 million."" Who gets that money? Because of documents filed with the court, we now know that Intellectual Ventures, owned by Nathan Myhrvold, gets 90 percent of Oasis Research's net profit. Intellectual Ventures sold Crawford's patents to Oasis on this condition. And Crawford didn't make out too badly, either. The documents say he gets 17 1/2 percent of the money that Intellectual Ventures makes. This kind of money makes the business of suing based on patents a very lucrative one, and it's getting easier. Every year more patents are issued than the year before. According to a Yale study, it's a hundred software patents a day. ""It took 121 years for us to get the first million patents,"" says Ewing. ""Now it takes, more or less, six years to get another million patents."" On Tuesday morning, the Obama administration announced it would be taking action against what it termed ""abusive"" patent lawsuits.

npr,N/A,Unfit forWork," In other words, people on disability don't show up in any of the places we usually look to see how the economy is doing. But the story of these programs -- who goes on them, and why, and what happens after that -- is, to a large extent, the story of the U.S. economy. It's the story not only of an aging workforce, but also of a hidden, increasingly expensive safety net.

          For the past six months, I've been reporting on the growth of federal disability programs. I've been trying to understand what disability means for American workers, and, more broadly, what it means for poor people in America nearly 20 years after we ended welfare as we knew it. Here's what I found.
 For the past six months, I've been reporting on the growth of federal disability programs. I've been trying to understand what disability means for American workers, and, more broadly, what it means for poor people in America nearly 20 years after we ended welfare as we knew it. Here's what I found. In Hale County, Alabama, nearly 1 in 4 working-age adults is on disability.[2] On the day government checks come in every month, banks stay open late, Main Street fills up with cars, and anybody looking to unload an old TV or armchair has a yard sale. Sonny Ryan, a retired judge in town, didn't hear disability cases in his courtroom. But the subject came up often. He described one exchange he had with a man who was on disability but looked healthy.  
            ""Just out of curiosity, what is your disability?"" the judge asked from the bench.
            ""I have high blood pressure,"" the man said.
            ""So do I,"" the judge said. ""What else?""
            ""I have diabetes.""
            ""So do I.""
           There's no diagnosis called disability.  You don't go to the doctor and the doctor says, ""We've run the tests and it looks like you have disability.""  It's squishy enough that you can end up with one person with high blood pressure who is labeled disabled and another who is not.  I talked to lots of people in Hale County who were on disability. Sometimes, the disability seemed unambiguous. ""I was in a 1990 Jeep Cherokee Laredo,"" Dane Mitchell, a 23-year-old guy I met in a coffee shop, told me. ""I flipped it both ways, flew 165 feet from the Jeep, going through 12 to 14,000 volts of electrical lines.  Then I landed into a briar patch. I broke all five of my right toes, my right hip, seven of my vertebrae, shattering one, breaking a right rib, punctured my lung, and then I cracked my neck."" Other stories seemed less clear. I sat with lots of women in Hale County who told me how their backs kept them up at night and made it hard for them to stand on the job. ""I used to cry to try to work,"" one woman told me. ""It was so painful."" People don't seem to be faking this pain, but it gets confusing. I have back pain.  My editor has a herniated disc, and he works harder than anyone I know.  There must be millions of people with asthma and diabetes who go to work every day. Who gets to decide whether, say, back pain makes someone disabled? As far as the federal government is concerned, you're disabled if you have a medical condition that makes it impossible to work. In practice, it's a judgment call made in doctors' offices and courtrooms around the country. The health problems where there is most latitude for judgment -- back pain, mental illness -- are among the fastest growing causes of disability. In Hale County, there was one guy whose name was mentioned in almost every story about becoming disabled: Dr. Perry Timberlake. I began to wonder if he was the reason so many people in Hale County are on disability. Maybe he was running some sort of disability scam, referring tons of people into the program. After sitting in the waiting room of his clinic several mornings in a row, I met Dr. Timberlake. It turns out, there is nothing shifty about him. He is a doctor in a very poor place where pretty much every person who comes into his office tells him they are in pain. ""We talk about the pain and what itâs like,"" he says. ""I always ask them, 'What grade did you finish?'"" What grade did you finish, of course, is not really a medical question. But Dr. Timberlake believes he needs this information in disability cases because people who have only a high school education aren't going to be able to get a sit-down job. Dr. Timberlake is making a judgment call that if you have a particular back problem and a college degree, you're not disabled.  Without the degree, you are. Over and over again, I'd listen to someone's story of how back pain meant they could no longer work, or how a shoulder injury had put them out of a job.  Then I would ask: What about a job where you don't have to lift things, or a job where you don't have to use your shoulder, or a job where you can sit down? They would look at me as if I were asking, ""How come you didn't consider becoming an astronaut?"" One woman I met, Ethel Thomas, is on disability for back pain after working many years at the fish plant, and then as a nurse's aide.  When I asked her what job she would have in her dream world, she told me she would be the woman at the Social Security office who weeds through disability applications. I figured she said this because she thought she'd be good at weeding out the cheaters. But that wasn't it. She said she wanted this job because it is the only job she's seen where you get to sit all day. At first, I found this hard to believe. But then I started looking around town. There's the McDonald's, the fish plant, the truck repair shop. I went down a list of job openings -- Occupational Therapist, McDonald's, McDonald's, Truck Driver (heavy lifting), KFC, Registered Nurse, McDonald's. I actually think it might be possible that Ethel could not conceive of a job that would accommodate her pain. There's a story we hear all the time these days that doesn't, on its face, seem to have anything to do with disability: Local Mill Shuts Down. Or, maybe: Factory To Close. Four years ago, when I was working as a reporter in Seattle, I did that story. I stood with workers in a dead mill in Aberdeen, Washington and memorialized the era when you could graduate from high school and get a job at a mill and live a good life. That was the end of the story. But after I got interested in disability, I followed up with some of the guys to see what happened to them after the mill closed. One of them, Scott Birdsall, went to lots of meetings where he learned about retraining programs and educational opportunities. At one meeting, he says, a staff member pulled him aside. ""Scotty, I'm gonna be honest with you,"" the guy told him. ""There's nobody gonna hire you â¦ We're just hiding you guys."" The staff member's advice to Scott was blunt: ""Just suck all the benefits you can out of the system until everything is gone, and then you're on your own.""  Scott, who was 56 years old at the time, says it was the most real thing anyone had said to him in a while.  There used to be a lot of jobs that you could do with just a high school degree, and that paid enough to be considered middle class. I knew, of course, that those have been disappearing for decades. What surprised me was what has been happening to many of the people who lost those jobs: They've been going on disability. Scott tried school for a while, but hated it. So he took the advice of the rogue staffer who told him to suck all the benefits he could out of the system. He had a heart attack after the mill closed and figured, ""Since I've had a bypass, maybe I can get on disability, and then I won't have worry to about this stuff anymore."" It worked; Scott is now on disability. Scott's dad had a heart attack and went back to work in the mill. If there'd been a mill for Scott to go back to work in, he says, he'd have done that too. But there wasn't a mill, so he went on disability. It wasn't just Scott. I talked to a bunch of mill guys who took this path -- one who shattered the bones in his ankle and leg, one with diabetes, another with a heart attack. When the mill shut down, they all went on disability.  I don't know what that rogue staffer meant when he told Scott Birdsall they were trying to hide those mill guys.  But signing up for disability benefits is an excellent way to stay hidden in one key way: People on disability are not counted among the unemployed. ""That's a kind of ugly secret of the American labor market,"" David Autor, an economist at MIT, told me. ""Part of the reason our unemployment rates have been low, until recently, is that a lot of people who would have trouble finding jobs are on a different program."" Part of the rise in the number of people on disability is simply driven by the fact that the workforce is getting older, and older people tend to have more health problems. But disability has also become a de facto welfare program for people without a lot of education or job skills.  But it wasn't supposed to serve this purpose; it's not a retraining program designed to get people back onto their feet. Once people go onto disability, they almost never go back to work. Fewer than 1 percent of those who were on the federal program for disabled workers at the beginning of 2011 have returned to the workforce since then, one economist told me. People who leave the workforce and go on disability qualify for Medicare, the government health care program that also covers the elderly. They also get disability payments from the government of about $13,000 a year. This isn't great. But if your alternative is a minimum wage job that will pay you at most $15,000 a year, and probably does not include health insurance, disability may be a better option. But, in most cases, going on disability means you will not work, you will not get a raise, you will not get whatever meaning people get from work.[3] Going on disability means, assuming you rely only on those disability payments, you will be poor for the rest of your life. That's the deal. And it's a deal 14 million Americans have signed up for.[4] As I got further into this story, I started hearing about another group of people on disability: kids. People in Hale County told me that what you want is a kid who can ""pull a check.""  Many people mentioned this, but I basically ignored it.  It seemed like one of those things that maybe happened once or twice, got written up in the paper and became conversational fact among neighbors. Then I looked at the numbers. I found that the number of kids on a program called Supplemental Security Income -- a program for children and adults who are both poor and disabled -- is almost seven times larger than it was 30 years ago. Jahleel Duroc (pictured above) is gap-toothed, 10 and vibrating with enthusiasm.   He's excited to talk to someone new, excited to show me his map of his neighborhood in the Bronx.  He's disabled in the eyes of the government because he has a learning disability. ""I like school,"" he told me. ""My favorite periods are math and science and art, and lunch and recess and  snack â¦ social studies and writing are my favorite."" His favorite thing about school, in other words, is everything. When you are an adult applying for disability you have to prove you cannot function in a ""work-like setting.""  When you are a kid, a disability can be anything that prevents you from progressing in school.  Two-thirds of all kids on the program today have been diagnosed with mental or intellectual problems. Jahleel is a kid you can imagine doing very well for himself.  He is delayed.  But given the right circumstances and support, it's easy to believe that over the course of his schooling Jahleel could catch up. Let's imagine that happens.  Jahleel starts doing better in school, overcomes some of his disabilities.  He doesn't need the disability program anymore.  That would seem to be great for everyone, except for one thing: It would threaten his family's livelihood. Jahleel's family primarily survives off the monthly $700 check they get for his disability.[5] Jahleel's mom wants him to do well in school.  That is absolutely clear.  But her livelihood depends on Jahleel struggling in school. This tension only increases as kids get older. One mother told me her teenage son wanted to work, but she didn't want him to get a job because if he did, the family would lose its disability check. I haven't taken a survey or anything, but I'm guessing a large majority of Americans would be in favor of some form of government support for disabled children living in poverty. We would have a hard time agreeing on exactly how we want to offer support, but I think there are some basic things we'd all agree on. Kids should be encouraged to go to school.  Kids should want to do well in school.  Parents should want their kids to do well in school.  Kids should be confident their parents can provide for them regardless of how they do in school.  Kids should become more and more independent as they grow older and hopefully be able to support themselves at around age 18. The disability program stands in opposition to every one of these aims. A federal program for disabled people was first proposed in the 1930s. Even then, a Social Security actuary was worried. ""You will have workers like those in the Dust Bowl area, people who have migrated to California and elsewhere, who perhaps have not worked in a year or two, who will imagine they are disabled,"" the actuary wrote.  The cost of the program could be higher than ""anything that can be forecast."" The actuary's warning gets at a central tension in a much bigger debate: What should we, as a country, do for people who aren't making it? Americans want to be generous. But Americans don't want to be chumps.  

            The first key pieces of the modern safety net were created in the 1930s, under Franklin Roosevelt. The first federal disability program was created in the '50s. A few years later, Lyndon Johnson pushed to expand the federal safety net further.
In the '80s, Ronald Reagan argued that a robust economy would do more to eliminate poverty than any federal program. When Reagan used the term ""welfare queen,"" it was clear where he stood. He didn't want to be a chump.

              Bill Clinton tried to appease both sides. He expanded many programs for the working poor, but he also promised to ""end welfare as we know it"" -- to nudge people off of public assistance, give them some job training, and force them to make it on their own. ""A society rooted in responsibility must first promote the value of work, not welfare,"" Clinton said. History has judged Clinton's welfare reform a big success.
But when you include disability in the story of welfare reform, the picture looks more ambiguous.

Part of Clinton's welfare reform plan pushed states to get people on welfare into jobs, partly by making states pay a much larger share of welfare costs. The incentive seemed to work; the welfare rolls shrank. But not everyone who left welfare went to work.

""A society rooted in responsibility must first promote the value of work, not welfare,"" Clinton said. History has judged Clinton's welfare reform a big success. But when you include disability in the story of welfare reform, the picture looks more ambiguous. Part of Clinton's welfare reform plan pushed states to get people on welfare into jobs, partly by making states pay a much larger share of welfare costs. The incentive seemed to work; the welfare rolls shrank. But not everyone who left welfare went to work. A person on welfare costs a state money. That same resident on disability doesn't cost the state a cent, because the federal government covers the entire bill for people on disability. So states can save money by shifting people from welfare to disability. And the Public Consulting Group is glad to help. PCG is a private company that states pay to comb their welfare rolls and move as many people as possible onto disability. ""What we're offering is to work to identify those folks who have the highest likelihood of meeting disability criteria,"" Pat Coakley, who runs PCG's Social Security Advocacy Management team, told me.  The company has an office in eastern Washington state that's basically a call center, full of headsetted women in cubicles who make calls all day long to potentially disabled Americans, trying to help them discover and document their disabilities: ""The high blood pressure, how long have you been taking medications for that?"" one PCG employee asked over the phone the day I visited the company. ""Can you think of anything else that's been bothering you and disabling you and preventing you from working?"" The PCG agents help the potentially disabled fill out the Social Security disability application over the phone. And by help, I mean the agents actually do the filling out. When the potentially disabled don't have the right medical documentation to prove a disability, the agents at PCG help them get  it.  They call doctors' offices; they get records faxed. If the right medical records do not exist, PCG sets up doctors' appointments and calls applicants the day before to remind them of those appointments. PCG also works very, very hard to make the people who work at the Social Security happy. Whenever the company wins a new contract, Coakley will personally introduce himself at the local Social Security Administration office, and see how he can make things as easy as possible for the administrators there. ""We go through even to the point, frankly, of do you like things to be stapled or paper-clipped?"" he told me. ""Paper clips wins out a lot of times because they need to make photocopies and they don't want to be taking staples out."" There's a reason PCG goes to all this trouble. The company gets paid by the state every time it moves someone off of welfare and onto disability. In recent contract negotiations with Missouri, PCG asked for $2,300 per person. For Missouri, that's a deal -- every time someone goes on disability, it means Missouri no longer has to send them cash payments every month. For the nation as a whole, it means one more person added to the disability rolls. In the past few decades, an entire disability-industrial complex has emerged. It has just one goal: Push more people onto disability. And, sometimes, it seems like the government is outmatched. This is especially true in the legal system. Daytime TV in many places is full of ads from lawyers who promise to fight the government and win the disability benefits you deserve. There are tons of YouTube videos about getting disability -- one lawyer, one webcam. The standard form is a let's-get-real chat about how to win this thing. There is one man who takes much of the credit for this industry: Charles Binder. ""When we started,"" Binder told me, ""I don't think anybody else was advertising."" What's more, most people who applied for disability were denied and never had a hearing. Binder, and the lawyers who followed him, changed that. ""I've created some of the problems for the government because so many people appeal,"" Binder says. When he started in 1979, Binder represented fewer than 50 clients.  Last year, his firm represented 30,000 people. Thirty thousand people who were denied disability appealed with the help of Charles Binder's firm. In one year.  Last year, Binder and Binder made $68.7 million in fees for disability cases. The way Binder tells it, he's is a guy helping desperate people get the support they deserve.  He is a cowboy-hatted Lone Ranger going to court to fight the good fight for the everyman. Who is making the case for the other side? Who is defending the government's decision to deny disability? Nobody. ""You might imagine a courtroom where on one side there's the claimant and on the other side there's a government attorney who is saying, 'We need to protect the public interest and your client is not sufficiently deserving,'"" the economist David Autor says.  ""Actually, it doesn't work like that.  There is no government lawyer on the other side of the room."" The Social Security Administration says disability hearings were never meant to be adversarial.  In these courtrooms, the judges are employees of Social Security.  So the judges are supposed to both represent the government and make a fair and objective determination.  But the judges themselves say this role can be difficult. Judge Randy Frye, who hears disability cases in North Carolina, told me he often finds himself glancing to where he imagines there should be a chair for the government attorney, as there would be in a normal case. ""There are always moments where you are concerned maybe you missed something,"" he says. ""You would turn to that chair and say, 'Counsel, I'm having trouble with this issue. Why does the government think this case should not be reversed?'""  Somewhere around 30 years ago, the economy started changing in some fundamental ways. There are now millions of Americans who do not have the skills or education to make it in this country.   Politicians pay lip service to this problem during election cycles, but American leaders have not sat down and come up with a comprehensive plan. In the meantime, federal disability programs became our extremely expensive default plan. The two big disability programs, including health care for disabled workers, cost some $260 billion a year. People at the Social Security Administration, which runs the federal disability programs, say we cannot afford this. The reserves in the disability insurance program are on track to run out in 2016, Steve Goss, the chief actuary at Social Security, told me. Goss is confident that Congress will act to keep disability payments flowing, probably by taking money from the Social Security retirement fund. Of course, the retirement fund itself is on track to run out of money by 2035. Goss and his colleagues have worked out a temporary fix under which the retirement and disability funds will both run out of money by 2033. He says he hopes the country will have come up with a better plan by then. › Responses to Our Disability Series › Comment On This Story

npr,"March 30, 2012",Take The Money And Run For Office," We imagine lobbyists stalking the halls of Congress, trying to influence lawmakers with cash. But often, it's the other way around: Members of Congress stalk lobbyists, looking for contributions. ""Most Americans would be shocked — not surprised, shocked — if they knew how much time a U.S. Senator spends raising money,"" Sen. Dick Durbin told us. There are special call centers across the street from the Capitol where Senators and Congressmen sit, often for hours a day, calling potential donors to ask for money. And lawmakers and their staffs are constantly trying to find lobbyists to organize fundraisers. For the most part, these are much more mundane than the fancy black-tie galas you sometimes hear about on the news. Take a look at this invitation for Rep. Tim Bishop, a democrat from New York. It's at a restaurant called Johnny's Half Shell. Cost: $500 to $2500. Time: 8:30 a.m. Eight thirty a.m. is not glamorous. And lots of these fundraisers happen at breakfast. Here's another invitation, this one for a a Republican candidate, Steve Daines of Montana. It's at the offices of the Associated General Contractors of America, a big trade group in town. Imagine 15 people eating appetizers in a conference room. Not glamorous. A congressional watchdog group called the Sunlight Foundation collects these invitations to fundraisers and puts them online. We crunched some of their numbers. (Notes on the data are at the bottom of this story.) Here's a breakdown of fundraisers, by category: Source: The Sunlight Foundation / Political Party Time Credit: Lam Thuy Vo / NPR Sifting through the invitations, the same venues come up again and again. Lunch at The Capitol Grille, dinner at Bullfeathers, cocktails at the Monocle. Here are the top 10 locations for fundraisers between 2008 and early 2012. They form a ring around the capitol. Not all of the events are boring. There are pheasant hunts, golf tournaments, sailing trips. This past week, for a thousand bucks, you could join South Dakota Senator John Thune at a Van Halen concert. Here's a count of fancy events from 2008 through early 2012: Source: The Sunlight Foundation / Political Party Time Credit: Lam Thuy Vo / NPR And here's a graph of all fundraisers in that time: Source: The Sunlight Foundation / Political Party Time Credit: Lam Thuy Vo / NPR So how do lobbyists actually pay to attend these events? Sometimes, they pay with plastic. There's often a space on the invitation to put your credit card number. Some lobbyists send their donation in ahead of time. Some want to hand over the money in person. ""We have a policy that all checks have to be hand delivered,"" says financial services lobbyist Scott Talbott. ""Wouldn't you remember if someone handed you a check rather than sent it in the mail?"" What does the money buy? What are corporations and special interests getting in return for the billions of dollars they spend lobbying each year? If you're cynical, you think money buys votes, and Washington is owned. Money drives everything. Lobbyists and politicians usually tell you the opposite. The money has no effect. After all, they say, donations come from both sides. Exporters vs. importers. Bankers vs. Realtors. Businesses vs. unions. The money cancels itself out. Rep. Barney Frank says both of those positions were caricatures. ""People say, 'Oh, it doesn't have any effect on me,'"" he says. ""Well if that were the case, we'd be the only human beings in the history of the world who on a regular basis took significant amounts of money from perfect strangers and made sure that it had no effect on our behavior."" On the other hand, Frank says, money isn't the only thing that influences lawmakers. ""If the voters have a position, the voters will kick money's rear end every time,"" he says.  But the fact is, a Congressman's district doesn't care about most legislation one way or another. Most of what Congress does affects the minutiae of tax law and business code and replacing the ""and"" in subsection b of title 1 with an ""or."" The only people who do care, or who even understand what the small print means are the lobbyists, and the industries and interests they represent. Fundraisers and campaign contributions don't buy votes, for the most part. But they buy access — they get contributors in the door to make their case in front of the lawmaker or his staff. And that can make all the difference. ""You may end up voting the wrong way because you haven't fully understood both sides of the story — even if you do have integrity,"" says Walt Minnick, a former Idaho Congressman who now works as a lobbyist. Minnick says, for example, that he met with representatives from the payday loan industry, which contributed to his campaign. ""Some of the folks in that industry were a little unsavory,"" he says. ""There weren't any people who were applying for payday loans that came in to see me,"" he says. Money in the political system helps explain why oil companies get big subsidies even while their business is booming, why the federal government provides flood insurance for rich people to build beach houses in hurricane zones, why corn syrup that goes in soft drinks gets federal subsidies and fruits and vegetables don't. If a congressman went in front of a town hall meeting and said ""For $5000, I'll sit down with any one of you and have breakfast, and you can tell me exactly how you'd like me to vote"" he'd be booed off the stage. But in Washington, that's what happens every day. *Note: For the graphics in this piece, we analyzed more than 13,000 event invitations.

""There is a lot of fear about Intellectual Ventures,"" says Chris Sacca, a venture capitalist who was an early investor in Twitter, among other companies. ""You don't want to make yourself a target."" Sacca wouldn't say if Intellectual Ventures had been in contact with any of the companies he's invested in. ""I tried to put you in touch with other people in this community to talk to you about this and they almost uniformly said they couldn't talk to you,"" Sacca told us. ""They were afraid to."" IV has the power to ""literally obliterate startups,"" Sacca says. Not surprisingly, Nathan Myhrvold (pictured above) has a very different story about Intellectual Ventures. When we ask him if IV is a patent troll, he laughs. ""That's a term that has been used by people to mean someone they don't like who owns patents,"" he says. ""I think you'd find almost anyone who stands up to their patent rights has been called a patent troll."" Intellectual Ventures, says Myhrvold, is just the opposite. It's on the side of the inventors. It pays inventors for patents. It gathers patents together into a huge warehouse of inventions that companies can use if they want. It's sort of like a department store for patents: Whatever technology you're looking for, IV has it. The company even has its own massive lab, with people walking around in white lab coats, mixing chemicals in beakers and looking at stuff under microscopes. There's a machine shop. A nanotechnology section. It's like a playground for scientists and engineers. IV says it has invented a nuclear technology that's safer and greener than existing technologies. A cooler that can keep vaccines cold for months without electricity. And the world's most high-tech mosquito zapper. But the lab is a tiny fraction of what IV does. The company has received about 1,000 patents on stuff it's come up with at the lab; it's purchased roughly 30,000 patents from other people. In fact, nothing that's come out of this lab — not the mosquito zapper, not the nuclear technology — has made it into commercial use. IV, for its part, says its job is to encourage invention, not to bring products to market. Imagine an inventor out there — someone with a brilliant idea, a breakthrough. This inventor has a patent, but companies are stealing his idea. And this inventor doesn't have the money or legal savvy to stop them. That's where IV comes in. It buys this inventor's patent, and it makes sure that companies who are using the idea pay for it. When we asked for an example of an inventor in this situation, someone with a breakthrough, who wasn't getting paid for it, two separate people at IV pointed us to a guy named Chris Crawford. Joe Chernesky, a vice-president at Intellectual Ventures, said: The neat thing about Chris is he had no idea how to get money for his patents. He had this great idea. These patents were immensely valuable because every technology company was adopting the technology. Yet he didn't know how to get paid. He eventually found Intellectual Ventures. So we bought those patents So we went to talk to Chris Crawford. But that turned out to be harder than we thought — and it led us on a five month journey, where things did not quite fit the story Intellectual Ventures was telling. *** When we followed up with IV to get Chris Crawford's contact info, the company told us it no longer owned Chris Crawford's patent. And Crawford probably wouldn't want to talk right now anyway, the company said, because he was in the middle of litigation. We started digging around and found Chris Crawford in Clearwater, Florida. As predicted, he never responded to our many emails and phone calls. You'll never hear from him in this story. But we were able to locate Chris's patent — number 5771354. He got it in 1998. And the way IV explained the patent to us, Chris Crawford invented something that we do all the time now: He figured out a way to upgrade the software on your home computer over the Internet. In other words, when you turn on your computer and a little box pops up and says, ""Click here to upgrade to the newest version of iTunes,"" that was Chris Crawford's idea. But when we looked at the patent, it seemed to claim a lot more than that. The name of the actual invention is ""an online back-up system."" The patent says this invention makes it possible to connect to an online service provider to do a bunch of stuff — software purchases, online rentals, data back ups, information storage. The patent makes it seem like Chris Crawford invented a lot of the most common things we do on the Internet. We weren't sure what to make of all this, so we went to see David Martin, who runs a company called M-Cam. It's hired by governments, banks and business to assess patent quality, which the company does with a fancy piece of software. We asked Martin to assess Chris Crawford's patent. At the same time Crawford's patent was being prosecuted, more than 5,000 other patents were issued for ""the same thing,"" Martin says. Crawford's patent was for ""an online backup system."" Another patent from the same time was for ""efficiently backing up files using multiple computer systems."" Yet another was for ""mirroring data in a remote data storage system."" And then there were three different patents with three different patent numbers but that all had the same title: ""System and method for backing up computer files over a wide area computer network."" Martin says about 30 percent of U.S. patents are essentially on things that have already been invented. In 2000, for example, the patent office granted a patent on making toast — patent number 6080436, ""Bread Refreshing Method."" We also asked Rick Mc Leod, a patent lawyer and former software engineer, to evaluate Chris Crawford's patent. ""None of this was actually new,"" he told us. Mc Leod looked to see if anyone else in the field was already doing the thing Chris Crawford claimed to invent in 1993, when he first filed his patent. Here's what he found: There were institutions, both academic and businesses, that used computers in this way, and I think it's a very interesting collection of things that were well known in the 1980s, with the exception that it adds the word ""Internet."" Mc Leod said he didn't think the patent should have been issued in the first place. *** For a long time, the patent office would have agreed with Rick Mc Leod. For a long time, the patent office was very reluctant to grant patents for software at all. For decades, the patent office considered software to be like language. A piece of software was more like a book or an article. You could copyright the code, but you couldn't patent the whole idea. In the 1990s, the Federal courts stepped in and started chipping away at this interpretation. There was a couple big decisions, one in 1994 and another in 1998, which overturned the patent office completely. A flood of software patents followed. A lot of people in Silicon valley wish that had never happened, including a very surprising group: computer programmers. ""I worked on a whole bunch of patents in my career over the years and I have to say that every single patent is nothing but crap,"" says Stephan Brunner, a programmer. Brunner says software patents on his own work don't even make sense to him. I can't tell you for the hell of it what they're actually supposed to do. The company said we have to do a patent on this. ... Personally, when I look at them, I'm not proud at all. It's just like mungo mumbo jumbo that nobody understands and makes no sense from an engineering standpoint whatsoever. (For the record, Stephan Brunner has a patent for a ""configurator using structure and rules to provide a user interface."") We met Stephan randomly one afternoon in South Park, a park in San Francisco where lots of tech people eat lunch. That same afternoon, we talked to a half dozen different software engineers. All of them hated the patent system, and half of them had patents in their names that they felt shouldn't have been granted. In polls, as many as 80 percent of software engineers say the patent system actually hinders innovation. It doesn't encourage them to come up with new ideas and create new products. It actually gets in their way. Many patents are so broad, engineers say, that everyone's guilty of infringement. This causes huge problems for almost anyone trying to start or grow a business on the Internet. ""We're at a point in the state of intellectual property where existing patents probably cover every behavior that's happening on the Internet or our mobile phones today,"" says Chris Sacca, the venture capitalist. ""[T]he average Silicon Valley start-up or even medium sized company, no matter how truly innovative they are, I have no doubt that aspects of what they're doing violate patents right now. And that's what's fundamentally broken about this system right now."" *** This brings us back to Chris Crawford's patent, the patent Intellectual Ventures cited as an example of how they encourage innovation by ensuring that inventors get paid. As we've said, this patent also seems to cover a big chunk of what happens on the Internet: upgrading software, buying stuff online, and what's called cloud storage. If you have a patent on all that, you could sue a lot of people. And, in fact, that's what's happening with Chris Crawford's patent. Intellectual Venures sold it to a company called Oasis research in June of 2010. Less than a month later, Oasis Research used the patent to sue over a dozen different tech companies, including Rackspace, GoDaddy, and AT&amp;T.; We called Oasis several times, but no one ever answered the phone. For a while, the company's voice mail message directed all questions to John Desmarais , a lawyer in New York. He didn't return our phone calls, but we did track him down at an intellectual property conference in San Francisco. He cited attorney-client privilege, and wouldn't tell us anything — not even who owns Oasis Research. (He did say he's a big fan of NPR.) There was hardly any public information about Oasis Research. No way to know who owned it, or how many employees it had. One of the few details that was available was an address: 104 E. Houston street, suite 190, Marshall, Texas. So we went to Marshall. The door to Oasis's office was locked, and through the crack under the door we could see there were no lights were on inside. It's kind of a cliche to knock on the door of the empty office. But we'd flown a long way. So we knocked. No one answered. The office was in a corridor where all the other doors looked exactly the same —locked, nameplates over the door, no light coming out. It was a corridor of silent, empty offices with names like ""Software Rights Archive,"" and ""Bulletproof Technology of Texas."" It turns out a lot of those companies in that corridor, maybe every single one of them, is doing exactly what Oasis Research is doing. They appear to have no employees. They are not coming up with new inventions. The companies are in Marshall, Texas because they are filing lawsuits for patent infringement. Patent lawsuits are big business in Marshall, which is part of the eastern district of Texas. Many people say that juries in Marshall are friendly to patent owners trying to get a large verdict. A local lawyer who has argued on both sides of numerous patent cases says it's actually because cases go to trial more quickly in Marshall than in other places. In any case, thousands of lawsuits are filed there, claiming that there's an inventor whose invention is being used without permission. But there are no inventors in Marshall, just corridors of empty offices. *** We did find one key detail about Oasis Research. It was in a legal document called a Certification of Interested Parties, which lists all the entities with a financial interest in Oasis. Tom Ewing, an intellectual property lawyer who makes a business of tracking IV, brought it to our attention. The Oasis document lists the usual parties — the plaintiff, the defendants, the attorneys involved. But it also includes one other name: Intellectual Ventures. Peter Detkin, an attorney who co-founded Intellectual Ventures with Nathan Myhrvold, told us that IV likely has a ""back-end arrangement"" with Oasis. In other words, Detkin said, ""We sell for some amount of money up front, and we get some percentage of the royalty stream down the road that is generated from these assets."" That means it's likely that Intellectual Ventures is taking a cut of whatever money Oasis gets from its lawsuits. Oasis is a company with no operations, no products, and, as far as we can tell, no employees, that is using a very broad patent from 1998 to sue over a dozen companies. As it happens, Detkin is the man who coined the term ""patent troll."" He came up with it back in in 1999, when he was working for Intel. We asked him how it feels to make money from an entity that's behaving much like the patent trolls he once condemned. He said: These are patents we used to hold, we no longer hold. And we ensure that we have no control over the actions of these third parties. They are independent actors. They are not Intellectual Ventures. They may be monetizing in ways we disagree with, but it's not our call. ...we believe in our heart that litigation is a highly inefficient way to do licensing. But let's not lose sight that litigation is just licensing by other means. In other words, we try to license these patents in a friendly way. But sometimes, you have to sue. Detkin then repeated the company line we heard from a lot of people at IV: The mission of Intellectual Ventures is to help inventors bring great ideas into the world. We asked if he could point us to a patent that was languishing, but then got licensed and built. ""There were two deals that were done,"" he said. ""One was with a toy company. The other was... I can't remember the technology, it was out there last Christmas, but I don't know how it's done."" He continued: The fact is the bulk of our patents, the bulk of our revenue is from people ... [who] were using it before we bought it, they were using it after we bought it, but we provided an efficient way for them to get access to the invention rights. This is a good thing, Detkin says, because it means inventors — the people who hold the patents — get paid. This, in turn, creates an incentive for people to come up with new inventions. But IV is not buying inventions. It's buying patents. And most software engineers will tell you, at least when it comes to software, a patent and an invention are not the same. Lots of patents cover things that people who write software for a living wouldn't consider inventions at all. *** All the big tech companies have started amassing troves of software patents — not to build anything, but to defend themselves. If a company's patent horde is big enough, it can essentially say to the world, ""If you try to sue me with your patents, I'll sue you with mine."" It's mutually assured destruction. But instead of arsenals of nuclear weapons, it's arsenals of patents. And this was a problem Intellectual Ventures founder Nathan Myhrvold said he was trying to solve when he first started the company. A problem that he and others from his company talked about at investor meetings around Silicon Valley. Chris Sacca attended one of those meetings a few years back. The pitch he heard was, basically, Intellectual Ventures helps defend against lawsuits. Intellectual Ventures has this horde of 35,000 patents — patents that, for a price, companies can use to defend themselves. Technology companies pay Intellectual Ventures fees ranging ""from tens of thousands to the millions and millions of dollars ... to buy themselves insurance that protects them from being sued by any harmful, malevolent outsiders,"" Sacca says. There's an implication in IV's pitch, Sacca says: If you don't join us, who knows what'll happen? He says it reminds him of ""a mafia-style shakedown, where someone comes in the front door of your building and says, 'It would be a shame if this place burnt down. I know the neighborhood really well and I can make sure that doesn't happen.' "" Sacca continues: Here's what's funny: When I've seen Nathan speak publicly about this and when I've seen spokespeople from IV they constantly remind us that they themselves don't bring lawsuits, that they themselves aren't litigators, that they are a defensive player. But the truth is the threat of their patent arsenal can't actually be realized, it can't be taken seriously, unless they have that offensive posture, unless they're willing to assert those patents. And so it's this very delicate balancing act that is quite reminiscent of scenes you see in movies when the mafia comes and visits your butcher shop and they say, ""Hey, It would be a real shame if they came and sued you. Tell you what: pay us an exorbitant membership fee into our collective and we'll keep you protected that way."" A protection scheme isn't credible if some butcher shops don't burn down now and then. In an email to us, Peter Detkin called the comparison to the mafia ""ridiculous and offensive."" Detkin wrote: We're a disruptive company that's providing a way for patent-holders to recognize value that wasn't available before we came on the scene, and we are making a big impact on the market. That obviously makes people uncomfortable. But no amount of name-calling changes the fact that ideas have value. (See Detkin's full response here.) True enough. But you can see why many people feel like lots of butcher shops have been burning. As we were reporting this story, more and more Intellectual Ventures patents started showing up in the hands of companies like Oasis, companies without employees or operations, that were formed for the purpose of filing lawsuits. They're known as non-practicing entities, or NPEs. One former IV patent was used by an NPE to sue 19 different companies, a broad assortment that included Dell, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, Visa, and UPS. These companies all have websites where, when you scroll your mouse over certain sections, pop-up boxes appear. The NPE said, ""We have the patent on that."" Which would make pretty much the entire Internet guilty of infringing the patent. Another group of former IV patents is being used in one of the most controversial and talked about cases in Silicon Valley right now. An NPE called Lodsys is suing roughly three dozen companies developing apps for the iPhone and for Android phones. Lodsys says it owns the patent on buying things from within a smartphone app. One interesting wrinkle about that case: The address for Lodsys is 104 E. Houston street, Marshall Texas, suite 190. The same exact address, down to the suite number, as Oasis Research. *** For this story, we called people who had licensing arrangements with IV, we called people who were defendants in lawsuits involving IV patents, we called every single company being sued by Oasis Research. No one would talk to us. Part of this is probably fear. Part of it is the fact that agreements with Intellectual Ventures include a non-disclosure agreement that's rumored to be the strictest in Silicon Valley. The Oasis Research case is still ongoing, but many of the original defendants seem to have settled. Michael Smith, the attorney in Marshall, Texas, represented one of those defendants. He was pretty sure they would have won the case if they'd gone to trial. But his client settled anyway. He says sometimes it makes more sense to settle and pay a license fee than to spend $2 million to $5 million on a court case. Tom Ewing, the lawyer who tracks Intellectual Ventures, says it's likely we'll see plenty more of these cases in the future. In order to purchase its 35,000 patents, Intellectual Ventures raised more than $5 billion from investors. Since its founding in 2000, Intellectual Ventures has generated $2 billion in revenue. But to keep its investors happy over the next 10 years, Ewing says, it's going to have to do a lot better than that: ""Intellectual Ventures seems to have signed a number of deals,"" Ewing says. ""If the stream of deals they're signing doesn't increase significantly, I imagine they would be forced to file more litigation, in order to achieve their revenue targets."" Ewing's prediction already seems to be coming true. Earlier this month, Intellectual Ventures itself filed a lawsuit in federal court against several companies it claimed were infringing some semiconductor patents it owns. *** In early July, the bankrupt tech company Nortel put its 6,000 patents up for auction as part of a liquidation. A bidding war broke out among Silicon Valley powerhouses. Google said it wanted the patents purely to defend against lawsuits and it was willing to spend over $3 billion to get them. That wasn't enough, though. The portfolio eventually sold to Apple and a consortium of other tech companies including Microsoft and Ericsson. The price tag: $4.5 billion dollars. Five times the opening bid. More than double what most people involved were expecting. The largest patent auction in history. That's $4.5 billion on patents that these companies almost certainly don't want for their technical secrets. That $4.5 billion won't build anything new, won't bring new products to the shelves, won't open up new factories that can hire people who need jobs. That's $4.5 billion dollars that adds to the price of every product these companies sell you. That's $4.5 billion dollars buying arms for an ongoing patent war. The big companies — Google, Apple, Microsoft — will probably survive. The likely casualties are the companies out there now that no one's ever heard of that could one day take their place.
